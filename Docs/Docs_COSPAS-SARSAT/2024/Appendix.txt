APPENDIX B - SAMPLE BOSE-CHAUDHURI-HOCQUENGHEM ERRORCORRECTING CODE AND 23 HEX ID CALCULATIONS
NOTE: The information in the Appendix is not aligned with the current text in the main body of
this document and requires an update.

B.1

Sample 48-Bit BCH Code Calculation

The error-correcting code used in 406 MHz messages is a shortened form of a (255,207) BoseChaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) code. The shortened form (250,202) consists of 202 bits of data
followed by a 48-bit sextuple error-correcting code. The code is used to detect and correct up to
six errors in the entire 250-bit pattern (bits 1 through 250 of the 406 MHz message).
Note: For the purpose of error correction, all calculations shall be performed with the full
255 length code. Therefore, 5 zeros are placed before the 202 data bits to form the 207-bit pattern
of the (255,207) BCH code. These padding zeros do not affect the generation of the BCH code as
described below.
For the (250,202) BCH code, a generator polynomial g(X) (the same as for (255,207) BCH code)
is defined as follows:
𝑔(𝑋) = 𝐿𝐶𝑀(𝑚1 (𝑋), 𝑚3 (𝑋), 𝑚5 (𝑋), 𝑚7 (𝑋), 𝑚9 (𝑋), 𝑚11 (𝑋))
where LCM = Least Common Multiple.
In the above case:
𝑚1 (𝑋) = 𝑋 8 + 𝑋 4 +𝑋 3 +𝑋 2 + 1
𝑚3 (𝑋) = 𝑋 8 + 𝑋 6 + 𝑋 5 + 𝑋 4 + 𝑋 2 + 𝑋 + 1
𝑚5 (𝑋) = 𝑋 8 + 𝑋 7 + 𝑋 6 + 𝑋 5 + 𝑋 4 + 𝑋 + 1
𝑚7 (𝑋) = 𝑋 8 + 𝑋 6 + 𝑋 5 + 𝑋 3 + 1
𝑚9 (𝑋) = 𝑋 8 + 𝑋 7 + 𝑋 5 + 𝑋 4 + 𝑋 3 + 𝑋 2 + 1
𝑚11 (𝑋) = 𝑋 8 + 𝑋 7 + 𝑋 6 + 𝑋 5 + 𝑋 2 + 𝑋 + 1
from which
𝑔(𝑋) = 𝑚1 (𝑋), 𝑚3 (𝑋), 𝑚5 (𝑋), 𝑚7 (𝑋), 𝑚9 (𝑋), 𝑚11 (𝑋)
= 𝑋 48 + 𝑋 47 + 𝑋 46 + 𝑋 42 + 𝑋 41 + 𝑋 40 + 𝑋 39 + 𝑋 38 + 𝑋 37 + 𝑋 35 + 𝑋 33 + 𝑋 32 +𝑋 31
+ 𝑋 26 + 𝑋 24 +𝑋 23 +𝑋 22 +𝑋 20 +𝑋 19 +𝑋18 +𝑋 17 +𝑋 16 +𝑋 13 +𝑋12 +𝑋 11 +𝑋10 +𝑋 7 +𝑋 4 +𝑋 2
+𝑋+1

B-2

a determination of g(X) results in the following 49-bit binary number
𝑔(𝑋) = 1110001111110101110000101110111110011110010010111
To generate the BCH code, an information polynomial, m(x) is formed from the 202 data bits as
follows:
𝑚(𝑋) = 𝑏1 𝑋 201 + 𝑏2 𝑋 200 + ⋯ + 𝑏201 𝑋 + 𝑏202
where b1 - is the first bit and b202 - is the last bit of the digital message.
m (X) is then extended to 250 bits by filling the least significant bits with 48 "0". The resulting
250-bit binary string is then divided by g(X) and the remainder, r(X), becomes the BCH code (the
quotient portion of the result of the module-2 binary division is discarded).
The above process may be clarified by the following example. Suppose, that the digital message
in the Minimum Requirement main field consists of the following data (decimal notation):
Digital Message

RLS function

Representation*
(MF #90 Ref. C/S A.002)
* As the length of the message in bits is not divisible by 4, the message is augmented, for ground
processing purposes, with two leading binary ‘0’s, which results in this revised hexadecimal message.
The division * described above is shown in Figure A1, and results in a 49-bit remainder of:
0010010010010101001001111110001010111101001001001
The most significant bit position of the remainder will always be a "0" and is deleted to obtain the 48bit BCH code.
Thus BCH Error-Correcting Code:
010010010010101001001111110001010111101001001001
REFERENCE
*

Modulo 2 division prohibits a "borrow" in the subtraction portion of the long division.

Sample 23 Hex ID Calculation

Using the same data as above the 23 Hex ID can be generated as shown below. It should be noted
that the 23 Hex ID cannot be formed directly from the transmitted message as additional bits have to
be added to it and the order of the digital message data has to be changed.
Referring to T.018 Section 3.6 and Table 3.9 and using the digital message data from above results in
the following:

APPENDIX C - BEACON ENCODED LOCATION CODING

C.1

ENCODED LOCATION PROTOCOL

This section defines the encoded location protocol which can be used with the 406 MHz beacon message
formats for encoding beacon position data in the digital message transmitted by a 406 MHz distress
beacon.

C.2

Summary

Encode location is represented differently in second generation beacons. In first generation beacons,
degrees, minutes and seconds were used. For second generation beacons, degrees and decimal part of the
degrees are used. Moreover, there is no coarse and fine offset fields: all information appears in one field.
Moreover, there is no separate return link location protocol. Instead, RLS data is contained in one of the
rotating fields.

C.3

Default Values in Position Data

The following default values shall be used in all encoded position data fields of the location protocols,
when no valid data is available:
a) all bits in the degrees are set to "1", with N/S, E/W flags set to "0"; and
b) the bits in the decimal parts of the degrees are set to the following patterns:
i. Latitude: 000001111100000 (Note the first five decimal parts of degrees bits are set to “0”s,
the middle five bits are set to “1” s and the last 5 bits are set to “0”s)
ii. Longitude: 111110000011111 (Note the first five decimal parts of degrees bits are set to
“1”s, the middle five bits are set to “0” s and the last 5 bits are set to “1”s)

The default pattern shall also be transmitted in the self-test mode. Additionally, if a location protocol
beacon includes an optional GNSS self-test and this fails to provide a valid location to encode into the
transmitted self-test message, then the beacon may radiate a single self-test message with the above default
data. However if a location protocol beacon with optional GNSS self-test obtains a location, then the
beacon shall radiate a single self-test message with encoded position.

C-2

C/S T.018 – Issue 1 Rev. 12
October 2024

This default bit pattern is different from first generation beacons. The degree bits are all set to “1”s as in
first generation beacons. But it is not easy to set the minutes bit to “0”s and the seconds bits to “1”s as the
decimal parts do not fall on integer minute or second boundaries.

C.4

Definition of Location Data Fields

The general structure of encoded location data is illustrated below.

latitude data (23 bits), including:
N/S flag (N=0, S=1)
degrees (0 to 90) in 1 degree increments
decimal parts of degrees
longitude data (24 bits), including:

bit 67:
bits 68-75:
bits 76-90

E/W flag (E=0, W=1)
degrees (0 to 180) in 1 degree increments
decimal parts of degrees

Encoded Location Data (1)

All position information is encoded as degrees, and decimal parts of latitude or longitude. Latitude
and longitude data are rounded off (i.e., not truncated) to the available resolution. All rounding shall
follow normal rounding conventions, for example with a resolution of 4, 0.000 to 1.999 shall be
rounded down to 0 and 2.000 to 3.999 shall be rounded up to 4. In each location field the Most
Significant Bit (MSB) is the lowest numbered bit in the message which is not a N/S, or E/W flag bit.
The following table illustrates the bit assignments for the degrees portion of the encoded location
field.

The following table illustrates the bit assignments for the decimal parts of the degrees portion of the
encoded location field. The equivalent in minutes and seconds is also provided. The resolution in
meters of each bit of longitude at the equator is also given, with the resolution of each latitude bit
0.169% less than for the longitude bit (at the equator). This reflects the fact that the circumference
around the earth at the equator is 40,075.16 Km and 40,008 Km for each meridian.

Instructions for converting Latitudes and Longitudes to a Binary Number

Global Navigation Satellite System receivers (e.g., GPS, Glonass, Galileo, BDS, etc.) normally output
position data using an IEC 61162-1 (NMEA 0183) formatted sentence. This will provide a position in
decimal degrees, minutes and parts of a minute as a decimal fraction in a defined format for example
“3546.295, N, 14821.291, W”. That is 35 degrees and 46.295 minutes North by 148 degrees and 21.291

C-4

minutes West. The size of the decimal fraction is not defined In IEC 61162-1, but in order to ensure
adequate accuracy initially and during subsequent rounding processes the number of digits after the
decimal point should not be less than 3.
In order to transmit this as a part of a Second Generation Beacon message it is necessary to convert the
position into a binary number expressed as degrees and a decimal fraction of a degree. The following
text provides an example of how this can be achieved.
Referring to C/S T.018 Table 3.1 Encoded GNSS Location we can see that the required message format
is as follows:

No of Bits
Content
1
N/S flag (N=0, S=1)
7
Degrees (0 to 90) in 1 degree increments
15
Decimal parts of a degree (0.5 to 0.00003)
1
E/W flag (E=0. W=1)
8
Degrees (0 to 180) in 1 degree increments
15
Decimal parts of a degree (0.5 to 0.00003)
The use of the bits for the N/S or E/W flags and the encoding of Degrees is straightforward and no
further explanation is deemed necessary. But converting minutes and a decimal fraction of a minute to
decimal parts of a degree and then to binary is less obvious, so an example of this is provided below.
Using the example above “3546.295, N” in binary would appear as follows:
N/
Degrees
Decimal Parts of a Degree
S
6 3 1
1/ 1/ 1/ 1/1 1/3 1/6 . . . . . . . . .
0/1

0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1
Initially the minutes and decimal fraction of minutes must be converted into a decimal fraction of a
degree, this is achieved by simply dividing the whole number by 60 e.g., 46.295 Minutes divided by
60 equals 0.77158333 Degrees. Again in order to maintain accuracy this number should be rounded to
no less than [5] decimal places e.g., [0.77158]. So 35 Degrees and 46.295 Minutes becomes [35.77158]
Degrees.
Two procedures for converting decimal parts of a degree to binary are provided below, the first uses
the Successive Multiplication Method while the second uses the Integral Number Conversion Method.
Successive Multiplication Method
1) Start with the decimal fraction part and multiply it by 2 (add it to itself)
2) If the result is greater than 1 then the first decimal fraction is a 1, if the result is less than 1
then the first decimal fraction is a 0
3) If the result was greater than 1 then subtract 1 from the result
4) Multiply the remaining number by 2
5) Repeat step 2) to obtain the second decimal fraction and then repeat steps 3) and 4)
6) Repeat step 5) for all the remaining decimal fractions

C-5

7) On completing the final step to obtain the fifteenth digit again repeat step 3), if the remainder
is 0.5 or greater then increase the computed binary number by one to round to the closest
possible number, or if the remaining number is less than 0.5 then use the binary number as
computed
The above example is provided below:
1) 0.77158 x 2 = 1.54316 thus the first digit is a 1
2) 1.54316 – 1 = 0.54316
3) 0.54316 x 2 = 1.08632 thus the second digit is a 1
4) 1.08632 – 1 = 0.08632
5) 0.08632 x 2 = 0.1728 thus the third digit is a 0
6) 0.17264 x 2 = 0.34528 thus the fourth digit is a 0
7) 0.34528 x 2 = 0.69056 thus the fifth digit is a 0
8) 0.69056 x 2 = 1.38112 thus the sixth digit is a 1
9) 1.38112 – 1 = 0.38112
10) 0.38112 x 2 = 0.76224 thus the seventh digit is a 0
11) Keep going as above
12) 0.78336 x 2 = 1.56672 thus the fourteenth digit is a 1
13) 1.56672 – 1 = 0.56672
14) 0.56672 x 2 = 1.13344 thus the last digit is a 1
15) 1.13344 – 1 = 0.13344
16) If the remaining number is 0.5 or greater then increase the computed binary number above by
one to round to the closest possible number, or if the remaining number is less than 0.5 then
use the binary number computed above
17) In this example, one computed 110001011000011, applying the rounding rule above means
that in this instance the actual binary number to use is the same
Integral Number Conversion Method
1) Start with the decimal fraction part and multiply it by 215 (2 to the power of 15)
2) Round the result to the nearest whole number
3) Convert this number to binary
4) The result is the binary fraction of the decimal fraction
The above example is provided below:
1) 0.77158 x 215 = 25283.13344
2) Rounding gives us 25283
3) Converting 25283 to binary gives 110001011000011

APPENDIX D - EXAMPLE OF LINEAR FEEDBACK SHIFT REGISTER
(LFSR) IMPLEMENTATION

The spreading PRN sequences are generated by a method equivalent to a Linear Feedback Shift
Register (LFSR) using the generator polynomial G(x) = X23 + X18 + 1. The generator polynomial
initialization values for I and Q components for beacon normal mode operation and for beacon selftest mode operation are given in Table 2.2.
This appendix details the generation of the 64 first chips of the normal I-component using the LSFR
implementation described in section 2.2.3 with the initialization value 000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0001
(see Table 2.2).
The last column gives the result of the PRN sequence generation (here 8000 0108 4212 84A1, as per
Table 2.2).

NOTE: When displaying a message as 63 hex characters, one bit is inserted at the beginning of the
message to indicate the PRN sequence (0 = Normal, 1 = self-test), followed by one zero, to form the 63
hexadecimal representation (2 bits + 250 bit message) for processing by the Cospas-Sarsat ground
segment.

APPENDIX G - EXAMPLES OF RLS GNSS RECEIVER TIMING
The operation of the RLS GNSS Receiver is defined in section 4.5.9.2 of this document. A set of examples
of RLS operation are provided in Table G.1, which cover a range of conditions to clarify the interpretation
of the Moffset timing, and are summarized below:
1)
2)
3)
4)
5)

UTC + Moffset of 59 minutes - No RLM received;
No UTC + Moffset of 1 minute - UTC acquired at 2:34 - RLM received at 4:07;
UTC + Moffset of 17 minutes - No RLM received;
UTC + Moffset of 20 minutes - RLM received at 2:29; and
UTC + Moffset of 11 minutes - RLM received at 0:45.

These examples are provided to ensure a common understanding of the expected functioning of the Moffset
capability and are intended to be used as the basis for the development test scenarios. The above five
examples are believed to cover all of the timing scenarios that can exist, between the activation of the RLS
GNSS Receiver and various values of Moffset, and specifically cover the following situations:
•
•
•
•
•
•

UTC acquired soon after beacon activated;
UTC not acquired until sometime after the beacon is activated;
no RLM received within the 6-hour RLS operational timeframe;
GNSS timing changes between the Moffset timing and the regular GNSS receiver timing;
correct occurrence of the first Moffset GNSS Receiver timing versus beacon activation time; and
ideal functioning of the RLS system.

APPENDIX H - RLS INFORMATION
H.1 Information to be Included in the User Manual of an RLS Type-1 Automatic Acknowledgement
Capable Beacon

This beacon has the Return Link Service (RLS) feature. The RLS feature is an indication on the
beacon that confirms to the beacon user that the distress signal from an activated beacon has been
localised by the Cospas-Sarsat system and is being sent to the responsible search-and-rescue (SAR)
authorities. It does NOT mean that a search and rescue has yet been organized/launched, but only
confirms that the distress alert has been received by the Cospas-Sarsat System and is being routed
to the appropriate SAR agencies.
The RLS is designed to send an acknowledgment to the beacon user in less than 30 minutes from
beacon activation (actual acknowledgement times are typically much quicker). Alerting of the
distress to SAR authorities is independent of (and may occur before) the RLS acknowledgment
indication on the beacon. The RLS specification is described in the Galileo SAR Service Definition
Document:
(https://www.gsc-europa.eu/sites/default/files/sites/all/files/Galileo-SAR-SDD.pdf).
RLS is an optional function and may not be permitted in all countries or for all beacon types. You
may visit the web page Where Can I Buy an RLS-Enabled Beacon?
(https://cospas-sarsat.int/en/beacon-ownership/rls-enabled-beacon-purchase) to learn the most
recent information about national support for RLS.
Cospas-Sarsat strongly recommends that you appropriately register your beacon. It only is possible
to register a beacon in the registry operated by the country matching the “country code”
electronically programmed into the beacon (or the International Beacon Registration Database
(IBRD) (https://www.406registration.com/) if the country uses the IBRD for their registrations).
For example, it only is possible to register a beacon with a French country code in France’s national
registry. However, owners of Belgian-coded beacons must register in the IBRD. The country code
is encoded in the beacon’s unique identification number (UIN, also called Hex ID), which is used
to register the beacon. Visit the web page Beacon Registration Contacts
(https://www.406registration.com/countriessupported.aspx) to see where you can register your
beacon.

H.2
Information to be Included in the User Manual of an RLS Type 3 TWC-Capable
Beacon
This beacon features the Two-Way Communication (TWC) capability.
The TWC function provides the beacon user with a confirmation indication that the distress signal
from an activated beacon has been detected by the Cospas-Sarsat System and is being transmitted to
the responsible Search-And-Rescue (SAR) Authorities.
It is important to note that this confirmation does NOT imply that a search and rescue operation has
been organized or initiated. In addition, the TWC feature enables the beacon user to establish
communication with the appropriate SAR Authorities.
TWC functionality relies on the exchange of information between beacon user and SAR Authorities,
aiming to facilitate and enhance SAR operations by allowing the beacon user to provide valuable
information to, or receive instructions from, SAR Authorities.
Upon beacon activation, a series of initial automatic questions will be displayed for the beacon user
to respond to. The answers encoded by the user will be transmitted to the SAR Authorities as soon as
possible. SAR Authorities have the capability to send new or previously asked questions and
instructions to the beacon user.
New messages sent from SAR Authorities will take priority over the initial automatic questions
should the user not have completed answering them.
The TWC is designed to send an acknowledgment to the beacon user in less than 30 minutes from
beacon activation (actual acknowledgement times are typically in the order of few minutes).
It is important to highlight that alerting the distress to SAR authorities is independent of, and may
occur before, the TWC acknowledgment indication on the beacon. The TWC specification is detailed
in the Galileo SAR Service Definition Document Issue (TBD).
TWC is an optional function and may not be permitted in all countries or for all beacon types. You
may visit the web page Where Can I Buy an TWC-Enabled Beacon? (TBD) to learn the most recent
information about national support for TWC.
Cospas-Sarsat strongly recommends that you appropriately register your beacon. It only is possible to

APPENDIX I - BASIC BEACON PROGRAMMING GUIDANCE
The following text provides basic guidance on programming an SGB, further details can be found in
document C/S G.005 and in Table 3.1 of this document.
TAC Number – The Type Approval Certificate number between 10,000 and 17,999 assigned to the
beacon by the Secretariat excluding the suffixes ‘M’ and ‘m’, see document C/S T.021 Section 2.2.1
for further details.
Serial Number – A numerical serial number between 0 and 16,383 assigned by the beacon
manufacturer to a beacon during production.
The TAC and Serial Number together form a unique identity for each beacon produced and shall not
be capable of being changed once programmed by the manufacturer. Once a manufacturer uses up all
available serial numbers, they shall apply to the Secretariat for an Extension TAC in order to continue
inserting a unique identity into every beacon that they produce. Identities shall never be reused, if for
example a beacon is scrapped, then that identity is not reused.
Country Code – The three-digit decimal country code based on the ITU MID related to the country
of beacon registration, or the normal place of residence of the beacon owner. Note that the Country
Code is not necessarily the same as the first 3 digits of the Maritime Mobile Service Identity (MMSI)
that may be assigned to a beacon associated with a vessel. The country code may be changed as
necessary during the life of a beacon to reflect changes of beacon registration or place of residence.
Vessel ID – If a Vessel (Aircraft or Ship) Identity is available / known then it should be included in
the beacon message using one of the following options:
SHIPS – In addition to the TAC and Serial Number ships may also be coded with either the MMSI of
the vessel or its Radio Call Sign, with preference being given to the former, if neither are available
then these fields are set to default values.
MMSI – An identity allocated to a beacon associated with a vessel in accordance with
Recommendation ITU-R M.585. This may be the MMSI assigned to a ship station as defined in ITUR M.585 Annex 1 Section 1 or the MMSI assigned to a craft associated with a parent ship as defined
in ITU-R M.585 Annex 1 Section 5. It shall not be the freeform number identity as defined in ITU-R
M.585 Annex 2 Section 2, commencing with 970, 972 or 974 which is only used to identify an AIS
locating signal transmitter if one is included as part of a 406 MHz beacon. However, if the beacon
includes an AIS locating signal, then the AIS identity commencing with 974 should be added in bits
94-123 AFTER the ships MMSI.
Note that if during the life of a beacon a vessel on which it is provided changes flag state and as a result
is allocated a different MMSI, then the MMSI in the beacon must be updated accordingly. This will
not affect the identity of the AIS locating signal, however, as this is not linked to the vessel identity.
Radio Call Sign – If an MMSI for the vessel is not available then the ships Radio Call Sign may be
inserted here instead. Radio Call Signs of up to 7 characters may be inserted.

C/S T.018 – Issue 1 Rev. 12

AIRCRAFT – In addition to the TAC and Serial Number aircraft may also be coded with one of three
forms of identity, either the Aircraft Registration Marking (commonly referred to as the Tail Number),
the Aviation 24-Bit Address (as used by the ADS-B system) or the Aircraft Operator designator
followed by a serial number. The Aviation 24-Bit Address may also be followed by the 3-letter Aircraft
Operator Designator (3LD), which is essential for ELT(DT)s.
Aircraft Registration Marking – This identity, often referred to as the aircraft Tail Number can be
encoded in up to 7 alphanumerical characters.
Aviation 24-Bit Address – This identity is becoming more common in larger aircraft as it is allocated
to an aircraft for use with systems such as the ADS-B. For ELT(DT)s required to meet the Automatic
Distress Tracking (ADT) requirements of the ICAO GADSS system, it is essential to code the
ELT(DT) with the aircraft 24-Bit address followed by the 3-letter Aircraft Operator Designator, as both
of these data items are required by the ICAO Location of an Aircraft in Distress Repository (LADR).
Note that the Aircraft 24-Bit address followed by the Aircraft Operator Designator can also be used to
code ELTs other than ELT(DT)s if required.
Aircraft Operator and Serial Number – This identity is less common but can be used to identify an
aircraft it consists of the identity of the aircraft operator followed by a serial number allocated to the
beacon by the aircraft operator to create a unique identity for that aircraft.
