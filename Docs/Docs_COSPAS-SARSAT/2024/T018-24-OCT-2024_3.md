# 3. DIGITAL MESSAGE CONTENT

## 3.1 Basic Structure

The digital message which is transmitted by the 406 MHz beacon consists of:

a) 202 information bits; and
b) 48 bits for BCH (250,202) error correction.

The 202 information bits are further divided into:

• 154 bits within the main data field (transmitted in every burst),
• 48 bits within a rotating data field (may be 1 of 16 different content types).

Message content structure is shown in Figure 3-1 below. Data transmission starts with bit 1, the left-hand (most significant) bit of the 154 bit main field.

## 3.2 Beacon Message Content – Main Field

The main field provides for the minimum requirements of document C/S G.008 using sub-fields as shown in Table 3.1 below. Note: additional coding guidance is included in Appendix I.

Unless stated otherwise all sub-fields are separately binary encoded, with the Least Significant Bit to the right (i.e., the highest numbered bit in that particular message field).

**Table 3.1: Minimum Requirement main field in the beacon message (transmitted in every burst)**

| C/S G.008 reqmt Para. | Description | Number of bits | Bit numbers in message | Content |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 3.7.1a | TAC Number | 16 | 1-16 (MSB=1) | 16-bit TAC # (0 to 65,535)*† |
| 3.7.1a | Serial Number | 14 | 17-30 | 14-bit serial number (0 to 16,383)* |
| 3.7.1a | Country code | 10 | 31-40 (MSB= 31) | A three-digit decimal country code number (0 to 999). Country codes are based on the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Maritime Identification Digit (MID) country code available on the ITU website: (www.itu.int/cgi-bin/htsh/glad/cga_mids.sh). |
| 3.7.1d | Status of homing device | 1 | 41 | On beacon activation a '1' indicates that the beacon is equipped with at least one homing signal and a '0' indicates that the beacon is not equipped with any homing signals or that they have been deliberately disabled. Once the homing signal in the beacon has been activated, a '1' indicates that at least one homing device is functional and transmitting. A '0' indicates that no homing device is functional, or it has been deliberately disabled. |
| | RLS function(s) | 1 | 42 | A '0' indicates a beacon without RLS capability or with this capability disabled. A '1' indicates a beacon with RLS capability enabled (e.g., RLS Type-1 automatic acknowledgement, RLS Type-2 manual acknowledgement, or RLS Type 3 two-way communication (message) service). |
| N/A | Test Protocol | 1 | 43 | A '0' indicates normal beacon operation. A '1' indicates a Test Protocol message for non-operational use. Selection of test protocol is not an end-user capability. |

*The TAC and serial number combination shall be unique (see section 3.6).
†TAC value range 65,521 - 65,535 is reserved for System beacons (e.g., reference and QMS beacons, calibration beacon, simulators, etc.) – See document C/S T.022.

| 3.7.1g | Encoded GNSS location | 1 7 15 1 8 15 (MSB= 45, 52, 68, 76) | 44 45-51 52-66 67 68-75 76-90 | Location* is provided to 3.4 m resolution max in the following order: N/S flag (N=0, S=1); Degrees (0 to 90) in 1-degree increments; Decimal parts of a degree (0.5 to 0.00003); (Default value of bits = 0 1111111 000001111100000). If the beacon does not have encoded location capability†, then these bits shall be set to the following default value: Bits = 1 1111111 000001111100000. E/W flag (E=0, W=1); Degrees (0 to 180) in 1-degree increments; Decimal parts of a degree (0.5 to 0.00003); (Default value of bits = 0 11111111 111110000011111). If the beacon does not have encoded location capability†, then these bits shall be set to the following default value: Bits = 1 11111111 111110000011111. |

*All position information is encoded as degrees and decimal parts of a degree, or as fractions of these units to be as close as possible to the actual position. Latitude and longitude data are rounded off (i.e. not truncated) to the available resolution. All rounding shall follow normal rounding conventions, for example with a resolution of 4, 0.000 to 1.999 shall be rounded down to 0 and 2.000 to 3.999 shall be rounded up to 4.

†If a beacon model has an external navigation input capability but is installed in a configuration in which a navigation signal will never be supplied to the interface (i.e., an ELT in a GA aircraft which cannot supply the navigation signal to the beacon), then this (no capability) is the preferred default that should be used under those circumstances. However, if the external navigation connection in the installed configuration is uncertain, then the alternate default (no position available at this time) should be used.

| Vessel ID (continued) | | 30 14 44 | 94-123 124-137 94-137 | This is followed by the vessel or aircraft identity. The following coding schemes are permitted: **1 - Maritime Mobile Service Identity:** A unique ship station identity in the format M₁I₂D₃X₄X₅X₆X₇X₈X₉ where MID indicates the flag state of the vessel and XXXXXX is the unique vessel number in accordance with ITU-R M.585 Annex 1 Section 1 encoded as a 9-digit number in binary format or for Craft Associated with a Parent Ship a unique identification in the format 98MIDXXXX where MID represents the administration having jurisdiction over the identity for the craft associated with a parent ship and XXXX represents a unique number assigned by the administration for that craft in accordance with ITU-R M.585 Annex 1 Section 5 encoded as a 9-digit number in binary format. If no MMSI is available, then insert the default decimal number 000111111. Followed if applicable by the Maritime Mobile Service Identity for the EPIRB-AIS system in the format 917243X₄X₅Y₆Y₇Y₈Y₉ in accordance with ITU-R M.585 Annex 2 Section 2 where only the last 4 digits (Y₆Y₇Y₈Y₉) are encoded here as a number in binary format. If there is no EPIRB-AIS device, then insert the default binary number 10101010101010 (10922). **2 - Radio call sign:** Is encoded using the modified-Baudot code shown in Table 3.2. This code enables 7 characters to be encoded using 42 bits (6x7=42), 94 to 135 (1 to 42 within the field). Two bits (136 and 137 (43 and 44 within the field)) are spare and shall be coded as 00. The modified-Baudot characters will be left justified with a modified-Baudot space (100100) being used where no character exists. If no Radio call sign is available, then insert a series of 7 spaces (100100). |

*This value is invalid when the test protocol flag, bit-43, is set to '0'.

This code enables 7 characters to be encoded using 42 bits (6x7=42), 94 to 135 (1 to 42 within the field). Two bits (136 and 137 (43 and 44 within the field)) are spare and shall be coded as 00. The modified-Baudot characters will be right justified with a modified-Baudot space (100100) being used where no character exists. If no Aircraft Registration Mark is available, then insert a series of 7 spaces (100100). **4 – Aviation 24 Bit Address†:** Shall either be encoded as a 24-Bit Binary Number, followed by 20 spare bits all of which are coded as 0 or shall be encoded as a 24-Bit Binary Number, followed by the 3-letter aircraft operator designator‡. The 3 letters are encoded using the modified-Baudot code shown in Table 3.2‡ (3x5 = 15 Bits) followed by 5 spare bits all of which are coded as 0. If there is no 3LD for the aircraft operator, then the 3LD is coded as "ZGA", i.e., bits 118 to 137 are set to 10001 01011 11000 00000. **5 - Aircraft operator and serial number*:** A 3-letter aircraft operator designator†. The 3 letters are encoded using the modified-Baudot code shown in Table 3.2ß (3x5 = 15 Bits). |

*WARNING: These coding schemes when used in an ELT(DT) (i.e., bits 138-140 are '011'), are NOT compliant with the mandatory data elements defined in ICAO document 10150 (either no 3LD aircraft operator (for 3 - Aircraft Registration Marking) or no aircraft identifier is available (for 5 - Aircraft operator and serial number)) and the associated data cannot be stored in the LADR. Manufacturers wishing to comply with ICAO GADSS requirements and use these coding options should consult the relevant Administration's aviation authorities for guidance prior to coding a beacon with these coding options.

†This coding (when the aircraft 24-bit address and the 3LD designator of the aircraft operator are provided in the "Vessel ID" field) is compliant with the mandatory data elements defined in ICAO document 10150, "Manual on the Functional Specifications for the Location of an Aircraft in Distress Repository (LADR)". The LADR is a facility, that will be used by Cospas-Sarsat, to support ICAO requirements for autonomous location of an aircraft in distress contained in Annex 6, Part I, section 6.18 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation.

‡A 3-letter aircraft operator designator (3LD) from the list of "Designators for Aircraft Operating Agencies, Aeronautical Authorities and Services" published by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) as document 8585.

ßThe aircraft operator designator (3 letters) can be encoded in 15 bits using a shortened form of the modified-Baudot code (i.e.: all letters in the modified-Baudot code are coded in 6 bits, with the first bit = "1". This first bit can, therefore, be deleted to form a 5-bit code).

## 3.4 Beacon Transmission Scheduling of Rotating Fields

Unless dictated otherwise by national or international regulations beacons shall transmit the rotating fields indicated below when making the following transmissions:

**Table 3.10: Rotating Field Transmission Conditions**

| Type of Beacon | Self-Test Transmission | Normal Transmission | Cancellation Message |
|---|---|---|---|
| All Beacons except ELT(DT)s, Beacons with RLS Functionality (Type 1, 2 and/or 3) and National Use Beacons | G.008 Objective Requirements Field #0 | G.008 Objective Requirements Field #0 | Cancellation Message Field #15 |
| ELT(DT)s (see Note 2) | In-Flight Emergency Field #1 | In-Flight Emergency Field #1 | Cancellation Message Field #15 |
| Beacons with RLS Type 1 Automatic Acknowledgement Functionality (see Note 3) | RLS Field #2 | RLS Field #2 alternating with G.008 Field #0 | Cancellation Message Field #15 |
| National Use Beacons (see Note 4) | National Use Field #3 | Field #3 and Field #0 on a schedule set by the relevant national authority | Cancellation Message Field #15 |
| Beacons with RLS Type-3 TWC (message) Functionality (see Note 5) | TWC Field #4 | TWC Field #4 alternating with G.008 Field #0 | Cancellation Message Field #15 |
| [Beacons with combined RLS Functionality (see Note 6)] | [RLS Field #2 and/or TWC Field #4] | [TWC Fields #2 and/or #4 alternating with G.008 Field #0 TWC Field #4 to have priority in TWC mode] | [Cancellation Message Field #15] |

**Notes**

1. All beacons always transmit the Main 154 Bit Message Field in every burst before transmitting a Rotating Field as defined above.

2. ELT(DT)s cannot include RLS (e.g., Type 1, Type 2, Type 3, etc.) functionality and therefore always transmit Rotating Field #1

3. Beacons with RLS Type 1 automatic acknowledgement functionality always transmit Field #2 in the first and subsequent odd numbered bursts and Field #0 in the second and subsequent even numbered bursts

4. National Use ELT(DT) Beacons shall transmit Field #3 and Field #1 on a schedule set by the relevant national authority. National Use Beacons with RLS Functionality shall transmit the selected fields, Field #4, Field #3, Field #2 and Field #0 on a schedule set by the relevant national authority. During a self-test all types of National Use beacons always transmit Field #3.

5. Beacons with RLS Type 3 TWC (message) functionality will transmit Field #4 in the first and subsequent odd numbered bursts and Field #0 in the second and subsequent even numbered bursts.

6. Beacons with combined RLS functionality which may be specified in the future.

## 3.5 Beacon Message Content – Error Correcting Field

A sample of the BCH Error-correcting Code Calculation is provided in Appendix B.

## 3.6 Beacon Coding and Hex ID

The manufacturer shall program a unique combination of TAC Number and Serial Number into every beacon before it leaves their factory. The TAC Number and Serial Number shall not be capable of being deleted from that beacon. Only approved devices shall be allowed to temporarily modify the TAC and Serial Number in the transmitted message (e.g., a programming adapter (see section 3.7)). If a unit is destroyed or recycled at the end of its life, the unique combination of TAC Number and Serial Number used in that beacon shall not be used in another beacon.

Beacon coding methods are defined in section 3.1 of this specification. Specific operational requirements that impact beacon coding, such as the encoding of position data, are defined in section 4 of this specification.

The 23 hexadecimal characters that uniquely identify each 406 MHz beacon are called the beacon 23 Hex ID. This is never transmitted by the beacon as such, rather it is generated locally by the SAR ground segment hardware and generated during beacon manufacture in order to apply identity labels to the beacon by extracting the bits shown below from the beacon data.

The 23 Hex ID is composed as follows:

**Table 3.11: Hex ID Contents**

| 23 Hex ID Bit No | Bits | Reference to Bits in Message Data | Content |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1 | n/a | Fixed Binary '1' |
| 2 to 11 | 10 | 31-40 | C/S Country Code |
| 12 | 1 | n/a | Fixed Binary '1' |
| 13 | 1 | n/a | Fixed Binary '0' |
| 14 | 1 | n/a | Fixed Binary '1' |
| 15 to 30 | 16 | 1-16 | C/S TAC No |
| 31 to 44 | 14 | 17-30 | Beacon Serial Number |
| 45 | 1 | 43 | Test Protocol Flag |
| 46 to 48 | 3 | 91-93 | Aircraft / Vessel ID Type |
| 49 to 92 | 44 | 94-137 | Aircraft / Vessel ID |
| **Total** | **92** | | **23 Hex** |

**Notes**

1) Fixing bits 1, 12, 13 and 14 of the 23 Hex ID to '1101' ensures that the 23 Hex ID cannot duplicate a First Generation Beacon 15 Hex ID.

2) The first 60 bits of the 23 Hex ID comprising the C/S Country Code, C/S TAC Number, Beacon Serial Number, Test Protocol Flag, Fixed Bits 1, 12, 13 and 14 and the first part of the Aircraft / Vessel ID together form a unique subset of the 23 Hex ID which form an SGB 15 Hex ID which is required for certain services, such as the Return Link Service. That is a unique SGB 15 Hex ID which may be obtained by simply truncating the 23 Hex ID and ignoring the last 8 Hex characters.

## 3.7 Programming Adapters

If a manufacturer chooses to offer an optional Programming Adapter with a particular Beacon Model (as defined in C/S T.021 section 1.3) then it shall comply with the requirements in this section.

A Programming Adapter shall only be capable of functioning with one particular Beacon Model; separate Beacon Models shall require the use of a different Programming Adapter. The mechanism used to prevent the use of a Programming Adapter with a model for which it was not designed shall be defined by the beacon manufacturer and may include physically keying of the adaptors, use of model recognition functionality, or other suitable design features.

Each Programming Adapter shall be given its own unique Serial Number by the beacon manufacturer. The manufacturer shall program a unique combination of TAC Number and Serial Number into every Programming Adapter before it leaves their factory. The TAC Number and Serial Number shall not be capable of being deleted from that Programming Adapter or being overwritten by any means. If a unit is destroyed or recycled at the end of its life, the unique combination of TAC Number and Serial Number used in that Programming Adapter shall not be used in another Programming Adapter.

All data stored in a Programming Adapter shall be in non-volatile memory.

A Programming Adapter shall be capable of having a Country Code and Vessel ID programmed into it, which may be capable of being changed and overwritten.

Every Programming Adapter shall be labelled in accordance with Section 4.5.11.

When a beacon connected to a Programming Adapter is activated, it shall continue to transmit in its message the ID supplied from the Programming Adapter for the duration of the beacon activation, even if the adapter subsequently becomes disconnected/disassociated from the beacon. When next activated (unless the Programming Adapter or another Programming Adapter has been reconnected / connected to the beacon in the meantime), it shall transmit the beacon's own unique TAC Number and Serial Number and the Country Code and Vessel ID. If a Programming Adapter is connected to an activated beacon, then the beacon shall ignore the Programming Adapter and continue to transmit the beacons own identity, until the beacon is deactivated and subsequently reactivated with the Programming Adapter connected, at which time it will then transmit the identity in the Programming Adapter.
