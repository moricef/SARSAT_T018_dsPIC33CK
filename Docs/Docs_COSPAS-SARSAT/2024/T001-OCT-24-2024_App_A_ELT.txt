ELT(DT) Location Protocol (see Figure A11)

A3.3.8.1
The ELT(DT) location protocol, identified by the flags F=1, P=0 and the protocol code in series no. 8
of Table A2-B, has the following structure:
a)

PDF-1:
bits 37 to 40:

4-bit protocol code defined as 1001;

bits 41 to 42:

2 bits for type of beacon identity set to “00” for Aircraft 24-bit address *, “01” for
Aircraft operators designator and serial number†, “10” for TAC with serial
number†, and “11” reserved for future use;

bits 43 to 66:

24 bits of beacon identification data:
• (Bits 41 and 42 “00”) a 24-bit aircraft address (only one ELT per aircraft can be
identified using this protocol); or
• (Bits 41 and 42 “01”) a 15-bit aircraft operator designator‡ in bits 43 to 57, and
a 9-bit serial number (1 to 511) assigned by the operator in bits 58 to 66; or
• (Bits 41 and 42 “10”) a 10-bit Cospas-Sarsat type approval certificate number
of the beacon (1 to 1,023) in bits 43 to 52, and a 14-bit serial number (1 to
16,383) in bits 53 to 66; or
• (Bits 41 and 42 “11”) reserved for future use and shall not be used for beacon
coding.

or ELT(DT) Location Test protocol when bits 43 to 66 are encoded with either all
”0”s, or all “1”s;

*

This coding is compliant with the mandatory data elements defined in ICAO document 10150, "Manual on the Functional Specifications
for the Location of an Aircraft in Distress Repository (LADR)" where bits 41 and 42 are set to “00” and the aircraft 24-bit address is
provided in PDF-1, and the 3LD designator of the aircraft operator is provided in the rotating PDF-2 field (when bits 113 and 114 are
set to “00” and bits 115 to 117 are set to “000” at the intervals described in section 2.2.1 of this document).
The LADR is a facility, that will be used by Cospas-Sarsat, to support ICAO requirements for autonomous location of an aircraft in
distress contained in Annex 6, Part I, section 6.18 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation.
†

WARNING: These coding options are NOT compliant with the mandatory data elements defined in ICAO document 10150 (no
aircraft identifier is available) and the associated data cannot be stored in the LADR. Manufacturers wishing to comply with ICAO
GADSS requirements and use these coding options should first consult the relevant Administration’s aviation authorities for guidance,
prior to encoding beacons with these protocols.
‡

The aircraft operator designator (3 letters) can be encoded in 15 bits using a shortened form of the modified-Baudot code (i.e.: since
all letters in the modified-Baudot code are coded in 6 bits, with the most significant bit = "1", this first (most significant) bit can be
deleted to form a 5-bit code per letter).

always selected to be as close as possible to the actual position and will have a maximum offset in PDF-2 of +/- 15 minutes.
