INTRODUCTION

1.1

Purpose

C/S T.018 – Issue 1 Rev. 12
October 2024

The purpose of this document is to define the minimum requirements to be used for the development and
manufacture of Second Generation 406 MHz Emergency Locator Transmitters (ELTs), Emergency
Position-Indicating Radio Beacons (EPIRBs), and Personal Locator Beacons (PLBs). In this document,
the term ELT indicates an aviation distress beacon, an EPIRB a maritime distress beacon, and a PLB a
distress beacon for personal use.
Specifications that are critical to the Cospas-Sarsat System are defined in detail. Specifications which
could be developed by the national authorities are identified in more general terms.
1.2

Scope

This document contains the minimum requirements that apply to Cospas-Sarsat 406 MHz distress
beacons. It is divided into the following sections:
a) Section 2 gives the technical requirements applicable to all types of beacons. When met,
these requirements will enable the beacons to provide the intended service in terms of
location probability and accuracy and will not disturb the system operation.
b) Section 3 deals with the beacon message content. Basic message structure as well as the
assignment and meaning of the available data bits are defined in this section.
c) Section 4 defines a set of environmental and operational requirements. These
requirements are not intended to be exhaustive and may be complemented by more
detailed national or international standards (e.g., RTCA standards for ELTs). However,
they represent the minimum environmental and operational performance requirements
for a 406 MHz beacon to be compatible with the Cospas-Sarsat System.
d) Appendix A provides a list of acronyms used in this document.
e) Appendix B provides a sample Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem error-correcting code
calculation.
f) Appendix C provides an example of beacon encoded location coding.
g) Appendix D provides an example of the first 64 bits of a Linear Feedback Shift Register
(LFSR) Implementation.
h) Appendix E provides a map of the BIT assignment numbers.
i) Appendix F provides an Moffset calculation and CRC code sample.

C/S T.018 – Issue 1 Rev. 12
October 2024

Type of Beacon

There are four different types of Cospas-Sarsat 406 MHz beacons; Emergency Locator Transmitters
(ELTs), Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacons (EPIRBs), Personal Locator Beacons (PLBs) and
Ship Security Alert System (SSAS) Beacons. This standard does not address requirements for Second
Generation SSAS Beacons.
In addition to the four different types of beacon there are up to three Classes of operating temperature
range for 406 MHz beacons as follows:
Class 0:
Class 1:
Class 2:

-55°C to +70°C
-40°C to +55°C
-20°C to +55°C

Any type of beacon can be supplied with a Class 0, Class 1 or Class 2 operating temperature range.
Unless otherwise stated herein this specification applies to all types and classes of 406 MHz beacons
identified in this section apart from SSAS beacons.
Emergency Locator Transmitters (ELTs)
Are designed for aviation distress purposes and are available as the following types; Automatic Fixed
(ELT (AF)), Automatic Portable (ELT (AP)), Survival (ELT (S)), Automatic Deployable (ELT (AD)),
and Distress Tracking ELT (ELT (DT)).
Automatic Fixed (ELT (AF))
This type of ELT is intended to be permanently attached to the aircraft before and after a crash and is
designed to aid SAR teams in locating a crash site.
Automatic Portable (ELT (AP))
This type of ELT is intended to be rigidly attached to the aircraft before a crash, but readily removable
from the aircraft after a crash. It functions as an ELT (AF) during the crash sequence. If the ELT does
not employ an integral antenna, the aircraft-mounted antenna may be disconnected and an auxiliary
antenna connected in its place. This type of ELT is intended to aid SAR teams in locating the crash site
or survivor(s).
Survival (ELT (S))
This type of ELT is intended to survive the crash forces, and then to be generally manually activated
by survivors. There are two sub categories of ELT(S) Category A which is buoyant and designed to
operate when floating in water and Category B which is non buoyant and may be manually or
automatically activated. This type of ELT is intended to aid SAR teams in locating survivor(s).

1-3

C/S T.018 – Issue 1 Rev. 12
October 2024

Automatic Deployable (ELT(AD))
This type of ELT is intended to be rigidly attached to the aircraft before a crash and automatically
deployed after the crash sensor has determined that a crash has occurred. This type of ELT should float
in water and is intended to aid SAR teams in locating the crash site.
Distress Tracking (ELT (DT))
This is a specific type of ELT designed to be activated prior to a crash and to function in compliance
with the ICAO GADSS* requirements for the Location of an Aeroplane in Distress, aimed at
establishing, to a reasonable extent, the location of an accident site within a 6 NM radius. It may be
activated automatically upon detection of a distress condition while in-flight or it may also be activated
manually.
Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacons (EPIRBs)
Are designed for maritime distress purposes and are available as Float free and Non Float Free types of
EPIRB.
Float Free EPIRB
This type of EPIRB is intended to float free of the vessel on which it is fitted if the vessel sinks, in which
case it will automatically activate, it can also be manually activated.
Non Float Free EPIRB
This type of EPIRB is intended to be manually released from its mounting bracket and then either
manually activated or dropped in the water so that it will then activate automatically. Some national
administrations permit the use of manually activated EPIRBs only without the automatic activation in
water feature.
Personal Locator Beacons (PLBs)
Are designed for use by persons in distress who may be on land, in the air or at sea.
1.4

Optional Features

Beacons may contain optional features that are defined in this specification.
Encoded location capability is optional, however in the case of ELT (DT) devices intended for in-flight
automatic activation the inclusion of a GNSS capability is mandatory.
All types of beacons (except current ELT(DT)s) may also be provided with the Return Link Service
capabilities (e.g., RLS Type 1 automatic acknowledgement and/or RLS Type 3 two-way communication
(message) service capability).
All types of beacons may be provided with one or more additional radio-locating transmitters for Homing
and On-scene Locating purposes.

C/S T.018 – Issue 1 Rev. 12

Additional Features

Beacons may contain additional functionality that may change the transmitted 406 MHz satellite
signal or affect other beacon parameters such as operating lifetime. For example, a beacon may
contain a flashing strobe light that while it probably has no effect on the transmitted signal, would reduce
the battery life.
Any additional functionality that is not defined in this specification shall not adversely degrade the
performance of the beacon to the extent that it no longer complies with this specification.

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

2.1

Beacon Functional Elements

C/S T.018 – Issue 1 Rev. 12
October 2024

This section defines requirements for the functional elements of spread-spectrum 406 MHz distress
beacons.
2.1.1

Transmitter Notional Functional Block Diagram

This section contains a notional functional diagram which describes the features which are described
in greater detail by later sections of this document.
Figure 2-1 illustrates a notional Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum - Offset QPSK (DSSS-OQPSK)
high level transmitter functional block diagram which may be used to better understand one possible
implementation of the beacon signal design. In this figure:
•

D(t) is the linear bit stream for each beacon burst running at 300 bits/second.

•

D(t) is split into parallel bit streams Ib(t) and Qb(t) made up of odd and even bits from D(t)
running at 150 bps each

•

A Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) function produces the two different chipping
segments Ci(t) and Cq(t) using the common generator polynomial G(X). Each chipping
segment runs at 38,400 chips/second. Each of Ci(t) and Cq(t) is produced by the LFSR
function using the specified unique I or Q channel LFSR initialization, and is reproduced
identically for each beacon burst for a given beacon mode of operation.

•

Ib(t) and Qb(t) are separately mixed with their respective different chipping segments. The
resultant on each channel can change state every chip period.

•

The resultant of the mixing on the Q component is then delayed by ½ chip period.

•

Both I and Q channels may then be low pass filtered (if necessary) and modulated onto
cosine and sine sinusoids.

•

The two modulated sinusoids are then summed.

•

The summation resultant is amplified, band pass filtered (if necessary), and then
transmitted as the outgoing beacon burst signal S(t).

Because the I and Q resultants are offset by ½ chip period from each other, when summed, the
resulting signal S(t) is bounded to a maximum phase shift of 90 degrees to help minimize amplitude
envelope variation.

Digital Message Generator

The digital message generator will key the modulator and transmitter so that the message defined
in section 3 is transmitted. This section describes the structure of the proposed signal.
2.2.1

Burst Transmission Interval

From beacon activation a total of 6 initial transmissions shall be made separated by fixed*
5s +0 /-0.2s intervals. The first transmission shall commence within 5 seconds of beacon activation†,
except for EPIRBs, where it shall commence within 8 seconds of beacon activation.
The beacon shall then transmit 59 bursts at nominally 30 second intervals. The time between the start
of two successive transmissions (TR) shall be randomized with uniform (flat) distribution around the
stated nominal value, so that intervals between the start of two successive transmissions are randomly
distributed over ± 5 seconds. The standard deviation over the 59 successive bursts of TR shall be
greater than 2.5 seconds. The minimum value of TR observed over the 59 successive bursts shall be

In this context, “fixed” refers to a repetition period which may vary within the tolerances allocated, and that no
deliberate randomization within this range is required.
†
Beacon activation is defined as the point in time at which the initiation of the activation event of the beacon occurs.
E.g., the activation events include pressing of the “ON” button, water sensor immersion, the start of a shock, or
deformation.
*

2-3

C/S T.018 – Issue 1 Rev. 12
October 2024

between 25.0 and 25.2 seconds, the maximum value of TR observed over the 59 successive bursts
shall be between 34.8 and 35.0 seconds.
Transmissions shall then occur at nominally 120 second intervals. The time between the start of two
successive transmissions (TR) shall be randomized with uniform (flat) distribution around the stated
nominal value, so that intervals between the start of two successive transmissions are randomly
distributed over ± 5 seconds. The standard deviation over the first 50 successive bursts of TR shall be
greater than 2.5 seconds. The minimum value of TR observed over the 50 successive bursts shall be
between 115.0 and 115.2 seconds, the maximum value of TR observed over the 50 successive bursts
shall be between 124.8 and 125.0 seconds.
For ELT DT transmission the first transmission shall commence within 5 seconds of beacon
activation. From beacon activation a total of 24 initial transmissions shall be made separated by fixed*
5 seconds + 0.0 / - 0.2 intervals. These transmissions shall be followed by 18 transmissions separated
by fixed 10 seconds + 0.0 / - 0.2. After the first 42 transmissions, ELT (DT) transmissions shall
continue at nominal intervals of 28.5 seconds until the end of the ELT (DT) operating lifetime. The
time between the start of two successive transmissions (TR) shall be randomized with uniform (flat)
distribution around the stated nominal value, so that intervals between the start of two successive
transmissions are randomly distributed over ± 1.5 seconds. The standard deviation over the first 73
successive bursts of TR shall be greater than 0.8 seconds. The minimum value of TR observed over
the 73 successive bursts shall be between 27.0 and 27.2 seconds, the maximum value of TR observed
over the 73 successive bursts shall be between 29.8 and 30.0 seconds.

For RLS Type 3 two-way communication (TWC) (message) capable beacons, from beacon
activation a total of 6 initial transmissions shall be made separated by fixed 5s +0 /-0.2s intervals.
The first transmission shall commence within 5 seconds of beacon activation, except for EPIRBs,
where it shall commence within 8 seconds of beacon activation.
The beacons with RLS Type 3 TWC functionality shall then transmit 119 bursts at nominally 30
second intervals. The time between the start of two successive transmissions shall be randomized
with uniform distribution around the stated nominal value, so that intervals between the start of
two successive transmissions are randomly distributed over ± 5 seconds.
Transmissions shall then occur at nominally 120 second intervals. The time between the start of
two successive transmissions (TR) shall be randomized with uniform (flat) distribution around
the stated nominal value, so that intervals between the start of two successive transmissions are
randomly distributed over ± 5 seconds.
The transmission schedule is summarized in Table 2.1.

In this context, “fixed” refers to a repetition period which may vary within the tolerances allocated, and that no
deliberate randomization within this range is required.

The total transmission time of each burst, measured at the 90 percent power points, shall be 1000 ms

2.2.3

Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum

The digital message shall be spread using two truncated segments of a common PRN (PseudoRandom Noise) maximum length sequence (m-sequence) producing symbols known as "chips".
These sequence segments shall be deterministic and must be known by the receiver.
The two truncated spreading PRN segments shall:

*

a)

be applied separately to the full duration of each beacon burst transmission with one
segment applied to the in-phase (I) component and the other applied to the quadrature (Q)
component of the signal;

b)

be transmitted as separate odd and even bits, starting with 1 as the first bit. Odd bits are
transmitted through the I channel and even bits the Q channel. For each bit, 256 chips are
taken from the PRN sequence such that a 0 bit is represented by the non-inverted sequence
and a 1 by the inverted sequence, equivalent to an exclusive-OR operation (XOR). The I
and Q signal components are spread separately, each by a factor of 256 (with half-chip
offset as shown in section 2.3.3). Then when the I and Q channels are combined the overall
spreading factor is 128 chips/bit.

c)

be generated by a method equivalent to a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) using
the same generator polynomial G(x) = X23 + X18 +1 (see Figure 2-2);

d)

be generated in matched pairs for the I and Q components defined in Table 2.2 for each
beacon mode;

For EPIRBs this value is 33 seconds.

C/S T.018 – Issue 1 Rev. 12
October 2024

2-5

e)

be truncated to the first 38,400 chips of the m-sequence generated using the prescribed
initialization values for each of the I and Q components with a 1/2 chip period delay
imposed on the Q component relative to the I component (refer to section 2.3.3);

f)

be applied to both I and Q components for the full one second duration of each beacon
burst transmission including preamble, information bits, and error correction bits, to give
a chipping rate of 38,400 chips/second for each component (see 2.3.1.2 for further details);
and

g)

be identical for each beacon burst transmission for any given burst mode.

Note that this spreading scheme method in fact allows for multiple possible non-overlapping matched
I and Q component chipping segment pairs, with each segment in each pair truncated to 38,400 chips.
The number of possible segments, 218, is determined by dividing the full m-sequence length for the
generator polynomial, by the truncated segment length, ((223)-1)/38,400 = 218 segments.
Non-overlapping pairs of segments can be selected from this set of 218 segments.

Figure 2-2: Linear Feedback Shift Register

The beacon shall be able to generate multiple PRN sequences segments, such as normal mode and
self-test mode, according to Table 2.2. In order to generate these PRN sequences segments, the
beacon may use a LFSR with multiple initialization values for PRN sequence segment generation.
Table 2.2 provides the generator polynomial initialization LFSR values for I and Q components for
beacon normal mode operation and for beacon self-test mode operation. In this table, registers are
labelled from 0 to 22. The registers shift from left to right the output from register 0. For clarity, the
feedback taps to be XOR’d are indicated in the table and match with the characteristic polynomial. The
output chip is taken from register 0. The table also provides the first 64 chips in the order of generation
from the LFSR. The 64 chip binary sequence has been displayed in hexadecimal format as
demonstrated in the example below the table with the leftmost chip in sequence being the first output.
The LFSR implementation (with associated initialization) leads to the correct generation of the whole
38 400 chips sequence, which can be verified to a high degree of confidence by confirming a perfect
match of the first 64 chips given in Table 2.2.

Preamble

The initial 166.7 ms of the transmitted signal shall consist of the combination of the first 6400 chips
of the two PRN code segments (each segment 38,400 chips long for the entire burst) used to spread
the I and Q message components as illustrated in Figure 2-3. There will be no useful information
encoded on either the I or Q components during the preamble. I and Q component information bits
shall all be set to ‘0’ during the preamble.

2.2.5

Digital Message

The remaining 833.3 ms of the transmitted signal shall contain a 250-bit message and will be at a
nominal bit rate of 300 bps.
2.2.6

Message Content

The content of the 250 bit message is defined in section 3.
The 250 bit message is composed of two parts:
a) the useful message: 202 bits containing the information transmitted by the beacon.
b) the error correction bits: 48 bits BCH(250,202) containing bits used for error correction
at reception.

In-Phase (I) and Quadrature-Phase (Q) Components

The odd bits of the 250-bit message are used to generate the in-phase (I) component of the message,
while the even bits are used to generate the quadrature-phase (Q) component of the message. The bit
rate for each channel will nominally be 150 bits/sec.
Each component starts with a 6400 chip preamble described in section 2.2.4 and is spread with the
PRN code segment described in section 2.2.3 as shown in Figure 2-4.

Transmitted Frequency

The following sections define the frequency stability requirements for the Carrier Frequency and the
Chip Rate. The specifications for the carrier frequency and the chip rate may be decoupled by using
separate oscillators.
2.3.1.1 Carrier Frequency Offset/Drift over aging, thermal, shock and vibration
a)

Long Term Stability Requirement
The carrier frequency tolerance shall be 406.05 MHz ±1200 Hz over 5 years or the
manufacturers’ declared beacon maintenance period*, whichever is greater; and

b)

Short Term Stability Requirement
This requirement applies throughout the operating temperature range and during
situations of temperature shock.
The maximum allowable carrier frequency variation shall be 7.4 ppb when measured
over 166.7 msec within the burst.

2.3.1.2 Chip Rate Accuracy and Variation
The average chip rate shall be 38 400 ± 0.6 chips/s.
The variation of the chip rate shall be ± 0.6 chips/s².
These values shall be met both when measuring over the preamble and on the entire burst.

*

The beacon maintenance should include validation of the frequency stability of the beacon.

Spurious Emissions

The in-band spurious emissions shall not exceed the levels specified by the signal mask in Figure 2-5,
when measured in a 100 Hz resolution bandwidth.

Figure 2-5: Spurious emission mask
Furthermore, out of band emissions must be limited to less than 1% of the total transmitted power*.
2.3.3

Modulation and Waveform

The RF modulation is Offset Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (OQPSK). The PRN sequences for the
in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) components of the signal are defined in section 2.2.3. The chips of
the I and Q components shall have an average offset of half a chip period ± 1% of the chip period
over the entire burst with I leading Q by one-half a chip period. In the constellation diagram shown
below, it can be seen that this will limit the phase-change to no more than 90° at a time. The peak to
peak amplitude of the I and Q components shall be on average within 15% of each other over the
entire burst. The Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) of the constellation points away from ideal,
measured at symbol level, shall be less than 2.5 % when measured over the entire burst.
Acceptable types of filters that may be used to produce an output waveform include half-sine (i.e.,
IEEE 802.15.4, Section 12.2.6), or root-raised cosine ([0.8 +/- TBD] roll-off factor may be used). If
other output filters are being considered for use, the Cospas-Sarsat Secretariat must be consulted in
advance so that they can consult with the Parties regarding the filter’s acceptability.
The figure below illustrates the OQPSK modulation mid-burst including the one-half chip delay on
the Q channel. In this figure, T represents the chip period.

of, or 25 ms after the end of, any 406 MHz burst. Power output rise time shall be less than 0.5 ms
measured between the 10% and 90% power points. Preamble content shall be transmitted during the
power rise time. Power output fall time shall be less than 0.5 ms between the 90% and the 10% power
points.
Between 25 ms after the end of any 406 MHz burst until 25 ms before the commencement of the next
406 MHz burst the power level in the 406.0 to 406.1 MHz frequency band shall not exceed -10 dBm.

2.4.2

Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP)

Power output is defined in terms of EIRP, not power into a 50-ohm load. Required EIRP varies with
elevation angle according to the table below. Greater than 65% of measured EIRP values shall meet
the limits shown. In addition, 90% of the measured EIRP values shall meet the limits shown at

Power output shall be maintained within the above limits throughout the minimum operating lifetime
of the beacon at any temperature throughout the operating temperature range. Changes in beacon
output power due to for example temperature and operation over the beacons minimum lifetime when
operating into a 50-ohm test load shall be taken into account during determination of compliance with
the minimum and maximum EIRP limits.
2.4.3

Antenna Characteristics

Antenna polarization shall be either circular (RHCP) or linear. Antenna pattern should be

Detachable Antenna
An antenna that is external to the casing of the beacon and that is attached directly to the beacon by
such means as an RF connector without any intermediate cable which can be removed and replaced
by the user.
Detachable antennas when measured directly at the antenna feed point shall achieve a VSWR not
greater than 1.5:1 referred to 50Ω.
Internal Antenna
An antenna that is contained within the case of the beacon where the user has no access to the antenna.
Remote Antenna
An antenna that is external to the casing of the beacon and which is remote from the beacon, being
attached to it by means of an RF cable. The antenna and the RF cable may be permanently attached
to the beacon (in this case the type and length of the antenna cable is fixed and is as supplied by the
beacon manufacturer) or one or both parts (antenna or cable) may be varied by the user or the installer
(in this case the type and length of the antenna cable may vary).
In either case, remote antennas, when measured directly at the antenna feed point, shall achieve a
VSWR not greater than 1.5:1 referred to 50Ω.
Remote Antenna without an Integrated Cable
In this configuration (e.g., an ELT installed in an aircraft) there may be more than one type of
approved antenna and the length and type of cable between the antenna and beacon may vary.
The characteristic impedance and minimum and maximum loss of the antenna feed cable shall be
specified by the beacon manufacturer. The combined beacon, antenna and cable shall meet the EIRP
requirements in section 2.4.2 (effective isotropic radiated power) when operating with the minimum
and maximum stated cable loss between the antenna and the beacon.
Remote Antenna with an Integrated Cable
In this configuration (e.g., a military PLB with a body worn antenna) the antenna and cable
combination is fixed and supplied by the beacon manufacturer (although there maybe more than one
approved combination for different applications) and the length and type of cable between the antenna
and beacon cannot be changed.
This combination utilising a specific manufacturer supplied integrated antenna cable shall be tested
with that cable.
All antennas and cabling arrangements to be approved with a beacon shall be specified by the
manufacturer and shall meet all the requirements of section 2.4.

Basic Structure

The digital message which is transmitted by the 406 MHz beacon consists of:
a) 202 information bits; and
b) 48 bits for BCH (250,202) error correction.
The 202 information bits are further divided into:
• 154 bits within the main data field (transmitted in every burst),
• 48 bits within a rotating data field (may be 1 of 16 different content types).
Message content structure is shown in Figure 3-1 below. Data transmission starts with bit 1, the

WARNING: These coding schemes when used in an ELT(DT) (i.e., bits 138-140 are '011’), are NOT compliant with
the mandatory data elements defined in ICAO document 10150 (either no 3LD aircraft operator (for 3 - Aircraft

associated data cannot be stored in the LADR. Manufacturers wishing to comply with ICAO GADSS requirements
and use these coding options should consult the relevant Administration’s aviation authorities for guidance prior to
coding a beacon with these coding options.
†
This coding (when the aircraft 24-bit address and the 3LD designator of the aircraft operator are provided in the
"Vessel ID" field) is compliant with the mandatory data elements defined in ICAO document 10150, "Manual on the
Functional Specifications for the Location of an Aircraft in Distress Repository (LADR)".
The LADR is a facility, that will be used by Cospas-Sarsat, to support ICAO requirements for autonomous location
of an aircraft in distress contained in Annex 6, Part I, section 6.18 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation.

§
The aircraft operator designator (3 letters) can be encoded in 15 bits using a shortened form of the modified-Baudot
code (i.e.: all letters in the modified-Baudot code are coded in 6 bits, with the first bit = "1". This first bit can, therefore,
be deleted to form a 5-bit code).

0 to 63 hours in one-hour steps (actual time since
activation shall be truncated, not rounded e.g., between
1 hour and 2 hours after activation shall be encoded as
1 hour). If the beacon is turned off and on again (even
quickly) this field shall be reset to zero. If the time is
greater than 63 hours, the value shall be set to 63.
0 to 2046 minutes (34 hours and 6 minutes) in one-minute
steps (actual time since last location shall be truncated, not
rounded e.g., between 34 minutes and 35 minutes after
activation shall be encoded as 34 minutes). Every time
that a new / updated encoded location is obtained this field
shall be reset to zero. Time is calculated from when the
location was obtained not when it was transmitted. If the
time is greater than 2046 minutes, the value shall be set to
2046. If the beacon has not yet obtained a location from
the GNSS receiver or is not equipped with encoded
location capability, then this field should be set to 2047 as
a default value.
Altitudes of ≤-400 metres to 15952 metres in steps of 16
metres (where altitudes ≤-400m are encoded as all zeros,
-384 metres is encoded as 0000000001 and sea level
would be encoded as 0000011001). Heights shall be
rounded to the nearest 16 metre step, not truncated. If the
height is greater than 15952 metres, the height shall be
considered as 15952 metres and encoded as 1111111110.
If altitude is not available (e.g., there is no location data or
only a 2D fix is available) then this field shall be encoded
as all 1’s.
The value of HDOP of the encoded location shall be
reported (first 4 bits) followed by the value of VDOP on
the following basis:
0000 = DOP <= 1;
0001 = DOP > 1 and <= 2;
0010 = DOP > 2 and <= 3;
0011 = DOP > 3 and <= 4;
0100 = DOP > 4 and <= 5;
0101 = DOP > 5 and <= 6;
0110 = DOP > 6 and <= 7;

Notes
1. All beacons always transmit the Main 154 Bit Message Field in every burst before transmitting a
Rotating Field as defined above.
2. ELT(DT)s cannot include RLS (e.g., Type 1, Type 2, Type 3, etc.) functionality and therefore
always transmit Rotating Field #1
3. Beacons with RLS Type 1 automatic acknowledgement functionality always transmit Field #2 in
the first and subsequent odd numbered bursts and Field #0 in the second and subsequent even
numbered bursts
4. National Use ELT(DT) Beacons shall transmit Field #3 and Field #1 on a schedule set by the
relevant national authority. National Use Beacons with RLS Functionality shall transmit the
selected fields, Field #4, Field #3, Field #2 and Field #0 on a schedule set by the relevant national
authority. During a self-test all types of National Use beacons always transmit Field #3.
5. Beacons with RLS Type 3 TWC (message) functionality will transmit Field #4 in the first and
subsequent odd numbered bursts and Field #0 in the second and subsequent even numbered bursts.
6. Beacons with combined RLS functionality which may be specified in the future.

Beacon Coding and Hex ID

The manufacturer shall program a unique combination of TAC Number and Serial Number into every
beacon before it leaves their factory. The TAC Number and Serial Number shall not be capable of
being deleted from that beacon. Only approved devices shall be allowed to temporarily modify the
TAC and Serial Number in the transmitted message (e.g., a programming adapter (see section 3.7)). If
a unit is destroyed or recycled at the end of its life, the unique combination of TAC Number and Serial
Number used in that beacon shall not be used in another beacon.
Beacon coding methods are defined in section 3.1 of this specification. Specific operational requirements
that impact beacon coding, such as the encoding of position data, are defined in section 4 of this
specification.
The 23 hexadecimal characters that uniquely identify each 406 MHz beacon are called the beacon
23 Hex ID. This is never transmitted by the beacon as such, rather it is generated locally by the SAR
ground segment hardware and generated during beacon manufacture in order to apply identity labels
to the beacon by extracting the bits shown below from the beacon data.
The 23 Hex ID is composed as follows:

Number, Test Protocol Flag, Fixed Bits 1, 12, 13 and 14 and the first part of the Aircraft / Vessel ID
together form a unique subset of the 23 Hex ID which form an SGB 15 Hex ID which is required for
certain services, such as the Return Link Service. That is a unique SGB 15 Hex ID which may be
obtained by simply truncating the 23 Hex ID and ignoring the last 8 Hex characters.

Programming Adapters

If a manufacturer chooses to offer an optional Programming Adapter with a particular Beacon Model
(as defined in C/S T.021 section 1.3) then it shall comply with the requirements in this section.
A Programming Adapter shall only be capable of functioning with one particular Beacon Model;
separate Beacon Models shall require the use of a different Programming Adapter. The mechanism
used to prevent the use of a Programming Adapter with a model for which it was not designed shall be
defined by the beacon manufacturer and may include physically keying of the adaptors, use of model
recognition functionality, or other suitable design features.
Each Programming Adapter shall be given its own unique Serial Number by the beacon manufacturer.
The manufacturer shall program a unique combination of TAC Number and Serial Number into every
Programming Adapter before it leaves their factory. The TAC Number and Serial Number shall not be
capable of being deleted from that Programming Adapter or being overwritten by any means. If a unit
is destroyed or recycled at the end of its life, the unique combination of TAC Number and Serial
Number used in that Programming Adapter shall not be used in another Programming Adapter.
All data stored in a Programming Adapter shall be in non-volatile memory.
A Programming Adapter shall be capable of having a Country Code and Vessel ID programmed into
it, which may be capable of being changed and overwritten.
Every Programming Adapter shall be labelled in accordance with Section 4.5.11.
When a beacon connected to a Programming Adapter is activated, it shall continue to transmit in its
message the ID supplied from the Programming Adapter for the duration of the beacon activation, even
if the adapter subsequently becomes disconnected/disassociated from the beacon. When next activated
(unless the Programming Adapter or another Programming Adapter has been reconnected / connected
to the beacon in the meantime), it shall transmit the beacon’s own unique TAC Number and Serial
Number and the Country Code and Vessel ID. If a Programming Adapter is connected to an activated
beacon, then the beacon shall ignore the Programming Adapter and continue to transmit the beacons
own identity, until the beacon is deactivated and subsequently reactivated with the Programming
Adapter connected, at which time it will then transmit the identity in the Programming Adapter.

beacon configuration(s) and under nominal System conditions. An ELT(DT) shall also provide valid
2D and altitude data.
As explained in section 1.2, the environmental and operational requirements defined in this section are
not intended to be exhaustive. They are minimum requirements, which may be complemented by
national or international standards.
4.2

Thermal Environment
4.2.1

Operating Temperature Range

Three standard classes of operating temperature range are defined, inside which all of the
requirements within this specification shall be met:
Class 0: -55°C to +70°C
Class 1: -40°C to +55°C
Class 2: -20°C to +55°C
4.2.2

Mechanical Environment

Beacons should be submitted to vibration and shock tests consistent with their intended use. These
requirements should be defined by national authorities, preferably using internationally-recognized
standards such as RTCA/DO-204 for ELTs.

C/S T.018 – Issue 1 Rev. 12
October 2024

Other Environmental Requirements

Other environmental requirements such as humidity tests, altitude tests, over/under pressure tests,
waterproofness tests, sand and dust tests, fluids susceptibility tests, etc., may be defined by national
authorities, preferably using internationally-recognized standards.
4.5

Operational Requirements
4.5.1

Duration of Continuous Operation

The minimum duration of continuous operation shall be at least 24 hours* at any temperature
throughout the specified operating temperature range.
For ELT(DT)s, at the end of the 370-minute period, the ELT(DT) shall continue transmitting on the
same schedule as before the 370-minute limit was reached until the ELT(DT) is either deactivated,
or runs out of battery life. Minimum duration of continuous operation requirements for Crash
Survivable ELT(DT)s can be found in section 4.5.15.5 and for Combined ELT(DT)s in section
4.5.16.7.
4.5.1.1 Battery Replacement Interval
The beacon battery replacement interval shall be declared by the beacon manufacturer. At the
end of the battery replacement interval the beacon shall continue to meet the required duration of
continuous operation as defined in 4.5.1 after accounting for all losses in battery capacity over
the declared battery replacement interval at ambient temperatures plus a safety factor of 65%
applied to all losses, except the loss due to self-discharge.
4.5.2

Other Operational Requirements

Other operational requirements such as installation and maintenance methods, remote monitoring,
activation methods on planes or boats, etc. may be defined by national authorities.
4.5.3

Radio-Locating Signal (for Homing and on-Scene Locating)

The distress beacon may transmit a 406 MHz Radio-Locating signal as defined in section 2.5.
ELT(DT)s are not required to provide a Radio-Locating signal.
The transmission of the 406 MHz satellite signal shall take precedence over any Radio-Locating
Signals. Homing signal types should be momentarily interrupted, delayed, rescheduled, or eliminated
according to the relevant standard for each type, in order to ensure that homing signals are not
transmitted at the same time as the 406-MHz signal to satellites.

*

For installations meeting IMO GMDSS requirements, a minimum operating lifetime of 48 hours (EPIRB) and 168 hours
(for Float Free VDR capsules) at any temperature throughout the specified operating temperature range is necessary. The
minimum operating lifetime for an ELT (DT) to meet the ICAO GADSS requirement at any temperature throughout
the specified operating temperature range shall be 370 Minutes. This duration is based on the ICAO standards for
Extended Diversion Time Operations (EDTO) and the maximum diversion time capability of existing aircraft types,
as of April 2018.

4-4

C/S T.018 – Issue 1 Rev. 12
October 2024

The distress beacon may transmit other radio-locating signals in compliance with appropriate national
or international standards. The inclusion of any Radio-Locating Signals within a beacon and the
prioritization of these Radio-Locating Signals is the responsibility of the appropriate national or
international bodies. The status of the radio-locating transmissions (e.g., operational or
non-operational) shall be monitored before each beacon satellite transmission and shall be encoded
in the beacon message as indicated in section 3.2.
Any such radio-locating device must satisfy all the national performance standards applicable to
radio-locating devices at the selected frequency.
Radio-Locating Signals shall not begin transmissions for at least 30 seconds (in order for the as
equipped status to be transmitted) but shall begin transmission within 5 minutes maximum after
beacon activation, except (if applicable) AIS signals which shall not be delayed for longer than
1 minute after beacon activation.
4.5.4

Beacon Self-Test Mode

In the self-test mode beacons shall transmit a 406-MHz signal with digital message encoded in
accordance with section 3. The content of the self-test message shall always provide the beacon
ID as defined in section 3.6, except when a Programming Adapter is attached to the beacon, in
which case it shall comply with section 3.7. The transmitted message shall be spread by a specific
sequence defined in section 2.2.3.
The self-test mode or GNSS self-test mode shall not be used for the purposes of repetitive
automated interrogation of the beacon status. A beacon (e.g., ELT(DT)) may contain a different
test mode that can be used for repetitive automated interrogation of its status, but operation of the
beacon in this different test mode shall not result in the transmission of a 406-MHz signal or other
radio locating signals (if applicable) nor interfere with the normal operation of the beacon.
4.5.4.1 Nominal Beacon Self-Test Mode
All beacons shall include a self-test mode of operation, which shall include a Verification of
Registration function as detailed in section 4.5.8.
The complete self-test transmission shall be limited to one 406 burst at full power and one burst
of each radio-locating signal at full power with a maximum duration of 3 sec each regardless of
the duration of activation of the self-test control. The radiolocating signals shall be transmitted
first in order of ascending frequency followed lastly by the 406 MHz satellite signal.
The self-test mode shall be activated by either a separate switch to that used to activate the beacon
or cancel transmissions; or a separate switch position of the beacon activation switch.
The duration of the self-test cycle shall not exceed 15 seconds.
The self-test function shall perform an internal check and provide a distinct indication that:
a) the self-test mode has been initiated within 2 seconds of activation;

4-5

C/S T.018 – Issue 1 Rev. 12
October 2024

b) RF power is being emitted at 406 MHz and the radio locating frequencies, if applicable;
and
c) the internal check has passed successfully within 15 seconds of activation; or
d) any of the items a), b) or c) has failed the self-test within 15 seconds of activation;
e) for RLS Type 1 automatic acknowledgment capable beacons an indication if the beacon
has RLS functionality enabled; and
f) for RLS Type 3 TWC (message) capable beacons an indication if the beacon has RLS
Type 3 TWC (message) functionality enabled.
The content of the encoded position data field of the self-test message shall be the default values
specified in section 3.
The beacon shall be designed to ensure an automatic termination of the self-test mode
immediately after completion of the self-test cycle and indication of the self-test results.
4.5.4.2 GNSS Beacon Self-Test Mode
In addition to the mandatory regular self-test, beacons may optionally include a GNSS self-test
mode.
ELT(DT) beacons shall include a GNSS self-test mode resulting in a single burst transmission.
Beacons which provide for the transmission of an encoded position in a GNSS self-test message
shall:
a) activate the GNSS self-test mode via a distinct operation from the normal self-test mode,
but the GNSS self-test mode may be activated via the same self-test switch(es) or
operation provided that it shall require a separate, deliberate action by the user that
would limit the likelihood of inadvertent GNSS self-test activation, and shall not result
in more than a single self-test burst regardless of the duration of activation of the GNSS
self-test control;
b) provide for that in the case of internal GNSS receivers powered by the primary* beacon
battery the number of GNSS self-tests shall be limited by the beacon design to prevent
inadvertent battery depletion;
c) provide a distinct indication that the GNSS self-test is underway and to register
successful completion or failure of the GNSS self-test;
d) provide, for beacons with internal navigation devices powered by the primary beacon
battery, a separate distinct indication that the limited number of GNSS self-test
opportunities have been attained;
e) ensure that the duration of the GNSS self-test is limited to a maximum time duration set
by the manufacturer, noting that:
- in the case where the beacon fails to encode the location into the 406 MHz message
within this time limit the GNSS self-test shall cease, the beacon shall indicate a

*

The primary battery is the battery which is powering the 406 MHz function.

4-6

C/S T.018 – Issue 1 Rev. 12
October 2024

GNSS self-test failure and may transmit a single self-test burst with default location
data (as described in Section 3),
- in the case where the beacon encodes the location into the 406 MHz message within
this time limit the GNSS self-test shall cease at that time (or before the time limit is
reached), indicate a GNSS self-test pass and transmit a single self-test burst
containing the valid location data; and
f) for beacons that provide a GNSS self-test using both the internal navigation device and
the external navigation interface:
-

when the GNSS Self-test is initiated, the beacon shall attempt to obtain location
data from the internal navigation device, if this data is available,

-

if location data is not available from the internal navigation device, then the beacon
shall obtain the location data from the external navigation interface,

-

if the location data from the external navigation interface is not available, the
beacon shall wait to obtain location data from the internal navigation device for the
maximum duration of the GNSS self-test, as declared by the beacon manufacturer.

Encoded Position Data*

4.5.5

4.5.5.1 General
Beacon position data, obtained from a navigation device internal, integral† or external to the
beacon, shall be encoded in the beacon message, if available. Beacons that do not provide
encoded position data shall indicate this within the message and shall transmit default location
data as defined in section 3. Beacons capable of encoding position data shall comply with all the
appropriate parts of section 4.5.5.
•
•
•

Section 4.5.5.2 applies to all beacons with an internal navigation device except
ELT(DT)s
Section 4.5.5.3 applies only to ELT(DT)s which must always include an internal
navigation device
Section 4.5.5.4 applies to all beacons (including ELT(DT)s) which include an external
navigation device input.

Thus, for example if an EPIRB has an internal navigation device and an external navigation
device input then it shall comply with both sections 4.5.5.2 and 4.5.5.4.
All times are measured since beacon activation unless specified otherwise.
Encoded position message content shall be as defined in section 3.
ELT (DT)s shall incorporate an internal navigation device and may incorporate an interface to
an external navigation device. The initial position transmitted in the first burst may be obtained
*

ELTs carried to satisfy the requirements of ICAO Annex 6, Parts I, II and III shall operate in accordance with ICAO
Annex 10.
†
An integral navigation device is a part of the beacon system but may be separate to the beacon transmitter and shall
comply with the performance requirements of an internal navigation device.

4-7

C/S T.018 – Issue 1 Rev. 12
October 2024

from either the internal navigation device or from the external navigation device input.
Subsequently all future positions shall only be obtained from the internal navigation device.
The transmission in the beacon message of this external source of position is only subsequently
allowed if the internal GNSS receiver is not able to produce a valid encoded position less than 1
second before the burst. If position data is available from both sources, within 1 second before
the burst, then the location produced by the internal GNSS receiver has the priority over the
external source of data*.
Operation or failure of an internal or external navigation device providing position data to the
beacon shall not degrade other aspects of beacon performance.
4.5.5.2 Internal Navigation Device
An internal navigation device shall be capable of global operation and should conform to an
applicable international standard.
An internal navigation device shall incorporate self-check features to ensure that erroneous
position data is not encoded into the beacon message. The self-check features shall prevent
position data from being encoded into the beacon message unless minimum performance criteria
are met. These criteria could include the proper internal functioning of the device, the presence
of a sufficient number of navigation signals, and sufficient quality of the signals.
Internal navigation device cold start shall be forced at every beacon activation. Cold start refers
to the absence of time dependent or position dependent data in memory, which might affect the
acquisition of the GNSS position.
With a clear view of the sky the distance between the static horizontal position provided by the
navigation device, at the time of the position update, and the actual navigation device static
position shall not exceed 30 m 95% of the time. The distance between the static vertical position
(altitude) provided by the navigation device, at the time of the position update, and the actual
navigation device static position shall not exceed 50 m 95% of the time.
The objective should be to provide a position with low geometric dilution of precision, however
if the only position available (whether this be 2D or 3D) has a high dilution of precision then this
position should be provided rather than being discarded in favour of not providing a position at
all.
The encoded position data shall be provided in a format compatible with the International
Terrestrial Reference System (ITRS) and its reference frames (ITRF) such as the WGS 84 or
GTRF. The difference between the chosen format and the ITRF shall not exceed 10 cm.

*

The internal navigation device or even the entire ELT(DT) may be powered by an external source prior to its activation
in order to comply with this requirement, but must be powered solely by the ELT(DT)’s internal power source
immediately after activation of the ELT(DT). The ELT(DT) shall have its own integral or internal power source.
However, when available, the ELT(DT) may use aircraft electrical power source during transmission after its
activation. ELT(DT) system minimum duration of continuous operation shall however be demonstrated with the
ELT(DT) own internal/integral power source.

4-8

C/S T.018 – Issue 1 Rev. 12
October 2024

The navigation device shall provide an indication of the potential error of each provided position
in terms of Horizontal Dilution of Precision (HDOP) and Vertical Dilution of Precision (VDOP)
and shall encode the respective DOP values in the message in accordance with section 3.3.
The navigation device shall provide the following additional information for each provided
position whether it has no Fix or was operating in 2D or 3D Mode and shall encode this data in
the message in accordance with section 3.3. If a valid 3D location (including height) is available
then this shall be transmitted, however if a 3D location is not available but a valid 2D location is
then this shall be transmitted instead. In this instance when the location changes from 3D to 2D
(or No Fix) the altitude shall be reset to the default value until such time as a 3D fix with altitude
is available.
First provision of encoded location within a transmitted message shall occur no later than the first
burst after 2 minutes from beacon activation with a 95% probability, with a clear view of the sky.
The Internal navigation device shall operate continuously during the initial 30 minutes period
following beacon activation. During this period the beacon shall acquire fresh position
information immediately prior to every transmission burst unless this becomes impractical due
to navigation signal constraints.
During the first 30 minutes after beacon activation the location transmitted by the beacon shall
always be the latest information provided by the navigation device. This applies even if the
quality of the location has become worse. The navigation device shall provide an updated
location at least every 1 second and the update immediately prior to the next scheduled
transmission burst shall be encoded and transmitted by the beacon within 1 second of receipt.
After the first 30 minutes, the navigation device shall make subsequent attempts to obtain an
initial location, or an updated location, as applicable, at least every 15 minutes from the end of
the last update attempt, for the remainder of the manufacturer declared minimum operating
lifetime of the beacon*. Whenever an updated location is obtained, it shall be encoded into the
next available beacon message to be transmitted.
Whenever the beacon has fresh encoded location data at the start of a burst, this shall be indicated
within the message by zeroing the “time from last encoded location” field as required by section
3.3.
If no position is available, then the beacon shall transmit either default position data (if it has no
position) or the last received position until such time as a fresh position is available. In addition,
the beacon shall compute the elapsed time since the last position update (or since activation) to
an accuracy of 10 seconds and provide this in the transmitted message to a resolution of the
nearest minute as required by section 3.3.
Each location update attempt shall require the navigation device to be operational for a period of
at least 90 seconds or until a valid location has been obtained whichever is shortest.

*

For EPIRBs used as the float-free recording medium for VDRs, after at least 48 hours, the update rate can be extended
to a maximum of once every 60 minutes for the remainder of the operating lifetime if required.

4-9

C/S T.018 – Issue 1 Rev. 12
October 2024

4.5.5.3 Internal Navigation Device ELT(DT)s only
An internal navigation device shall be capable of global operation and should conform to an
applicable international standard.
An internal navigation device shall incorporate self-check features to ensure that erroneous
position data is not encoded into the beacon message. The self-check features shall prevent
position data from being encoded into the beacon message unless minimum performance criteria
are met. These criteria could include the proper internal functioning of the device, the presence
of a sufficient number of navigation signals, and sufficient quality of the signals.
The ELT (DT) navigation system shall be cold-started on initial power-up (ELT(DT) in ARMED
mode see section 4.5.6.1) but shall not be cold started if the ELT(DT) is subsequently activated
or between ELT(DT) transmissions. Cold start refers to the absence of time dependent or position
dependent data in memory, which might affect the acquisition of the GNSS position.
With a clear view of the sky the distance between the static horizontal position provided by the
navigation device, at the time of the position update, and the actual navigation device static
position shall not exceed 30 m 95% of the time. The distance between the static vertical position
(altitude) provided by the navigation device, at the time of the position update, and the actual
navigation device static position shall not exceed 50 m 95% of the time. The objective should be
to provide a position with low geometric dilution of precision, however if the only position
available (whether this be 2D or 3D) has a high dilution of precision then this position should be
provided rather than being discarded in favour of not providing a position at all.
The encoded position data shall be provided in a format compatible with the International
Terrestrial Reference System (ITRS) and its reference frames (ITRF) such as the WGS 84 or
GTRF. The difference between the chosen format and the ITRF shall not exceed 10 cm.
The navigation device shall provide the following additional information for each provided
position whether it has no Fix or was operating in 2D or 3D Mode and shall encode this data in
the message in accordance with section 3.3. If a valid 3D location (including height) is available
then this shall be transmitted, however if a 3D location is not available but a valid 2D location is
then this shall be transmitted instead. In this instance when the location changes from 3D to 2D
(or No Fix) the altitude shall be reset to the default value until such time as a 3D fix with altitude
is available.
First provision of encoded location within a transmitted message shall occur within 5 seconds*
after ELT(DT) activation with a 95% probability, with a clear view of the sky. If, after the
ELT(DT) activation, current navigation data is not available, then the ELT(DT) shall transmit its
first and subsequent 406-MHz messages with the last position available prior to the ELT(DT)
activation (which shall be retained in beacon memory for this purpose). The position provided in
the transmitted message shall also contain the UTC time that relates to when the position was
obtained in accordance with Table 3.4 “Time of Last Encoded Location” (to an accuracy of 1
second), until either navigation data becomes available or 24 hours has elapsed. To facilitate the
provision of position data prior to activation, the ELT(DT) shall attempt to update the position
retained in memory from either the internal navigation device or the external navigation input at
The ELT(DT)’s internal navigation device or even the entire ELT(DT) may be powered by an external source prior
to its activation in order to comply with this requirement.
*

4-10

C/S T.018 – Issue 1 Rev. 12
October 2024

intervals of no longer than 2 seconds. If no position was available prior to the ELT(DT)
activation, or if 24 hours have elapsed without an updated position becoming available, the
ELT(DT) shall transmit the default position until such time, as navigation data becomes available
from an internal GNSS receiver or, if applicable, from an external navigation device.
The Internal navigation device shall operate continuously during the initial 30 minutes period
following beacon activation, subsequently each location update attempt prior to every 406 MHz
transmission shall require the navigation device to be operational for a period of at least 15
seconds or until a valid location has been obtained whichever is shortest. If the internal navigation
device fails to provide a location during the two location update attempts immediately previous
to the current location update attempt, then the current update attempt shall be extended to a
minimum duration of 25 seconds scheduled immediately prior to the next planned location
update. After the first hour following beacon activation, the internal navigation device shall also
be operational for a period of at least 180 seconds once every hour thereafter, to ensure that the
device can download any necessary navigation message updates.
ELT(DT)s shall attempt to acquire fresh position information prior to every 406 MHz
transmission (unless this becomes impractical due to navigation signal constraints) for the entire
operating lifetime of the ELT (DT) and shall encode the latest position obtained within less than
1 second prior to each burst into that transmission. If an updated position is not available within
1 second immediately prior to every 406 MHz transmission, then the ELT(DT) shall transmit the
latest position that it has, unless this position is more than 24 hours old, in which case it shall
revert to transmitting the default position until such time as an updated position is available.
ELT (DT)s shall provide the UTC time of the last encoded location to an accuracy and resolution
of 1 second and provide this in the transmitted message as required by section 3.3, Table 3.4. If
UTC is not available for an encoded location, or if the time of the last encoded location is over
24 hours old then the ELT(DT) shall transmit default data.
4.5.5.4 External Navigation Device Input
It is recommended that beacons, which are designed to accept data from an external navigation
device, be compatible with an applicable international standard, such as the IEC Standard on
Digital Interfaces (IEC Publication 61162) and that any difference between the ITRS and the
datum employed by the receiver should be less than 10 cm. The input should be able to provide
all relevant position data as required by sections 3.2 and 3.3, this includes horizontal position,
vertical position (altitude), time of this position to an accuracy of 1 second, HDOP, VDOP and,
No Fix or 2D or 3D operating. Examples of suitable Maritime IEC 61162-1 sentences to achieve
this objective include GNS and GSA and Aviation ARINC 429 labels to achieve this objective
include Label 101, 102, 310, 311 etc. The beacon user manual shall include details of the
acceptable interfaces.
In addition to providing horizontal position and altitude the external navigation input shall
provide an indication of the potential error of each provided position in terms of Horizontal
Dilution of Precision (HDOP) and Vertical Dilution of Precision (VDOP) and shall encode the
respective DOP values in the message in accordance with section 3.3, except for ELT(DT)s
transmitting Rotating Field #1 as this field does not include provision for HDOP or VDOP.

4-11

C/S T.018 – Issue 1 Rev. 12
October 2024

The external navigation input shall indicate for each provided position whether it has no Fix or
was operating in 2D or 3D Mode and the beacon shall encode this data in the message in
accordance with section 3.3. If a valid 3D location (including height) is available then this shall
be transmitted, however if a 3D location is not available but a valid 2D location is then this shall
be transmitted instead.
In static conditions the distance between the horizontal position provided by the external
navigation input, at the time of the position update, and the position transmitted by the beacon
shall not exceed 20 m. The distance between the vertical position (altitude) provided by the
external navigation input, at the time of the position update, and the position transmitted by the
beacon shall not exceed 40 m.
First provision of encoded location within a transmitted message shall occur within 5 seconds
with navigation data available at the external navigation device input.
During the first 30 minutes after beacon activation the location transmitted by the beacon shall
always be the latest information provided by the external navigation input. This applies even if
the quality of the location has become worse. The external navigation input shall provide an
updated location at least every 1 second and the update immediately prior to the next scheduled
transmission burst shall be encoded and transmitted by the beacon within 1 second of receipt.
After the first 30 minutes, the beacon shall access the external navigation input prior to every
transmission and shall encode the position, if available, into the next transmitted burst. Whenever
the beacon has fresh encoded location data at the start of a burst, this shall be indicated within
the message by zeroing the “time from last encoded location” field (except for ELT(DT)s) as
required by section 3.3, Table 3.3. ELT(DT)s shall include the UTC time of the last encoded
location as required by section 3.3, Table 3.4.
If no position is available, then the beacon shall transmit either default position data (if it has no
position) or the last received position until such time as a fresh position is available. In addition,
the beacon shall compute (except for ELT(DT)s) the elapsed time since the last position update
(or since activation) to an accuracy of 10 seconds and provide this in the transmitted message to
a resolution of the nearest minute as required by section 3.3, Table 3.3.
If a beacon designed to operate with an external position source is installed in a configuration
which does not supply any or all of the expected GNSS data (e.g., position, status, etc.), then the
beacon should transmit default data for all of the missing data items. Note: This could occur in
the installation of an ELT in an aircraft which cannot provide any or all of the expected GNSS
data due to limitations of the installation.

4.5.6

Beacon Activation

Beacons shall have a means of manual activation and deactivation and may optionally also include
means of automatic activation (for ELT (DT)s see section 4.5.6.1 below).
The beacon shall be designed to prevent inadvertent activation.
Within 1 second after activation, the beacon shall provide a visual indication that it has been activated.

4-12

C/S T.018 – Issue 1 Rev. 12
October 2024

For beacons which can be remotely activated, there shall be an indicator on both the remote activation
device and the beacon.
The beacon (except ELT(DT)s) shall track time since activation to an accuracy of 10 minutes and
provide this in appropriate transmitted messages to a resolution of the nearest one hour as required
by section 3.3.
After activation the beacon shall commence transmissions in accordance with section 2.2.1, thereafter
the beacon shall not transmit more frequently than the minimum burst transmission interval (as
defined in section 2.2.1) regardless of the duration of activation of any controls or the activation of
any combination of controls. Once activated and transmitting, the activation of any control other than
the ‘Off’, ‘Reset’ or ‘Cancellation’ controls shall not stop the beacon from transmitting.
4.5.6.1 ELT(DT) Modes of Operation
ELT(DT)s shall allow for automatic and manual means of activation. All ELT(DT)s shall
include a means of receiving information from the aircraft to determine whether the ELT(DT) is
on the ground or in the air and shall take this status into account when activated. ELT(DT)s shall
also have means of deactivation by the same means of activation which shall be followed by a
cancellation message sequence.
Standalone ELT(DT)s (i.e., those that do not comply with either sections 4.5.15 or 4.5.16) should
function as follows. National Administrations or Aviation Authorities may define additional
functionality.
Table 4.1: Expected Stand-alone ELT(DT) Behaviour

If the beacon is activated in one aircraft state (e.g., in-flight) and the aircraft transitions to another
state (e.g., on-ground) while the beacon is still transmitting, the beacon transmission
characteristics should behave as indicated for the new aircraft state as per the table above.
Consequently:
•

*

If the ELT(DT) has been automatically activated by the triggering system*, it shall
only be de-activated by the same means.

For example, triggered by an external source in compliance with EUROCAE ED-237.

4-13

C/S T.018 – Issue 1 Rev. 12
October 2024

•

If the ELT(DT) has been automatically activated by the beacon sensors*, it shall only
be deactivated by manually resetting the beacon.

•

If the ELT(DT) has been manually activated (i.e., from the cockpit), it shall only be
manually de-activated.

•

If the ELT(DT) has been activated by any combination of activation means, it can
only be de-activated once each activation means has been deactivated.

•

Bits 186 to 189 of the ELT(DT) message shall indicate the most recent means of
activation. If one means of activation is removed but others remain then Bits 186 to 189
shall revert to indicating the previous most recent means of activation.

Thus, an ELT(DT) shall as a minimum have the following modes of operation:
OFF – The complete ELT(DT) (and any related components) is/are unpowered
ARMED – The ELT(DT) or some parts of it may if required be powered up, such that
when it is activated by an automatic triggering system† or manually, it can start
transmitting within 5 seconds and meet the requirements in this specification for
ELT(DT)s including the provision of encoded location in the first burst. However, until
the ELT(DT) is activated there are no outputs from the ELT(DT) at all (e.g., no 406 MHz
or Homing Signal transmissions)
ON – The ELT(DT) has been either activated by an automatic triggering system and/or
has been manually activated and is transmitting 406 MHz signals in full compliance with
the ELT(DT) requirements in this specification.
RESET – The ELT(DT) is deactivated and ceases transmitting distress alerts and instead
transmits a sequence of cancellation messages as defined by Section 4.5.7. Upon
completion of the cancellation message sequence, the ELT(DT) reverts to the ARMED
condition. The ELT(DT) can only be deactivated as defined above.
4.5.7

Beacon Activation Cancellation Function

The beacon shall include a beacon activation cancellation function. This shall be a separate function
from the on/off capability of the beacon for all beacons except ELT(AD), ELT(AF), and ELT(DT).
The cancellation function shall be protected from inadvertent activation and shall be triggered by two
simple and independent actions that provide confidence in intentional cancellation action by the user.
The beacon shall provide an indication of the transmission of cancellation messages.
When the beacon is deactivated with the cancellation function, the beacon shall transmit the first
cancellation messages within 5 seconds, and transmit a total of 10 identical cancellation messages at
intervals of 10 seconds ±0.5 seconds, after which time the beacon shall cease transmitting. In the case
the beacon is activated (e.g., triggered) during the cancellation sequence, the beacon shall terminate
the cancellation transmission sequence and reinitiate the alert sequence per section 2.2.1 (unless
otherwise specified in this section).

*
†

For example, triggered by G-switch / deformation.
For example, triggered in compliance with EUROCAE ED-237 or by G-switch / deformation.

4-14

C/S T.018 – Issue 1 Rev. 12
October 2024

When the beacon activation cancellation function is initiated it shall comply with section 3.4,
Table 3.1 and Table 3.9.
4.5.7.1 Additional Requirements for ELT(AD), ELT(AF) and ELT(DT) Beacons
For ELT(AD), ELT(AF), and ELT(DT) beacons, the cancellation transmission sequence shall
start when either:
• the beacon is active (ON mode), and the user turns the beacon off (OFF mode) from the
front panel on the beacon, or
• the beacon is active (ON mode), and an automatic or manual RESET is initiated,
provided no other activation sources are present.
For ELT (DT)s the cancellation function shall include a means of automatic cancellation from
the same source(s) as the aircraft automatic activation.
4.5.7.2 Additional Requirements for ELT(AP) Beacons
For ELT(AP) beacons, when connected to the remote control and indicator panel (i.e., when
mounted in the aircraft), the cancellation message sequence shall be initiated whenever a beacon
is deliberately turned off or reset provided no other activation sources are present (thus overriding
the cancellation function on the ELT unit itself).
For ELT(AP) beacons, when not connected to the remote control and indicator panel (i.e., when
external to the aircraft), the cancellation message sequence shall only be initiated when the
cancellation function on the ELT unit is enabled.
4.5.7.3 Additional Requirements for all other Beacons
For all other beacons, the cancellation function shall only be activated through a dedicated
control.
Manual operation of the cancellation function shall only result in the transmission of a set of
cancellation messages when either the beacon is active and transmitting distress alerts or when
the cancellation function is activated within 180 seconds of a previously activated beacon having
been turned off, deactivated or reset.
4.5.8

Verification of Registration

See footnote.*

*

C/S G.008 Section 3.13 describes an operational beacon requirement to design the beacon such that the registration
status of the beacon is displayed to the beacon user. The registration status shall remain valid for a period of two years
and the beacon shall be designed such that the self-test function indicates by default that the beacon is not
registered. National Administrations have a variety of registration renewal requirements and methods for registration
verification. The lack of a common approach makes it difficult to identify a specific specification to achieve the
requirement at this time. It's possible that in the future that a common approach would be identified, but until such
time, compliance with this requirement is not met by SGBs in C/S T.018.

4.5.9

C/S T.018 – Issue 1 Rev. 12
October 2024

RLS Functions

If a beacon is equipped with a Return Link Service (RLS) functionality and is configured to transmit
the RLS Rotating Field, it shall meet the following additional requirements.
4.5.9.1 RLS GNSS Receiver
The RLS beacon shall contain an internal GNSS Receiver capable of receiving and decoding
Return Link Messages (RLMs) from a Cospas-Sarsat recognised Return Link Service Provider
(RLSP) and of providing these messages to the beacon in an IEC 61162-1 RLM compliant
sentence or an equivalent proprietary RLM sentence defined by the GNSS receiver manufacturer.
If the GNSS receiver is capable of processing signals from only one GNSS constellation, this
shall be the associated RLS provider’s constellation, and satellites should be tracked above 5
degrees of elevation.
If the GNSS receiver is capable of processing signals from several GNSS constellations
(multi-constellation GNSS receiver), such a receiver shall prioritize the reception from satellites
of the GNSS constellation associated with the RLS provider above 5 degrees of elevation over
other GNSS constellations.
The following Return Link Messages have been defined by Cospas-Sarsat to date:
•
•

RLM Type 1 Automatic Acknowledgement – An automated response that simply
acknowledges receipt of the RLS request by the System.
RLM Type 3 Two-way Communication (message) – a return link message (RLM) that
supports the exchange and acknowledgement of information between the beacon user
and SAR Authorities using pre-defined questions, information or instructions.

The definition of the Type 1 RLM message content included as part of the Galileo L1 navigation
message is defined in the Galileo Open Service Public Signal in Space ICD Issue 1.3.
The definition of the Type 3 RLM message content included as part of the Galileo L1 navigation
message is defined in the Galileo Open Service Public Signal in Space ICD Issue TBD.
4.5.9.2 RLS Type 1 GNSS Receiver Operation
4.5.9.2.1

Operation Cycle

In addition to the beacons normal GNSS receiver operating cycle as defined in section
4.5.5.2 or as defined by the beacon manufacturer if the receiver is designed to be active
more frequently than those requirements, the RLS Type 1 automatic acknowledgement
beacon shall:
a) when encoded with RLS functionality (i.e., transmitting an RLS Rotating
Field) maintain the GNSS receiver in an active mode of operation such that it
can continuously check for receipt of an RLM message and Coordinated
Universal Time (UTC), for a minimum period of 30 minutes after beacon
activation, or until a valid RLM message is acquired, or until the beacon is
deactivated, whichever occurs first;

4-16

C/S T.018 – Issue 1 Rev. 12
October 2024

b) as soon as possible determine UTC from the GNSS receiver and maintain a
clock for at least 6 hours from the time the beacon was first activated, to an
accuracy of better than three seconds (once UTC has been acquired) or until
the beacon is deactivated (if UTC is not acquired see (e) below);
c) if an RLM message has not been received within the first 30-minute period,
then at the end of this time, utilize UTC time to next activate the GNSS receiver*
at the next occurrence of UTC Moffset† minutes to check for receipt of an RLM,
for a minimum period of 15 minutes, or until an RLM message is acquired
(e.g., if the first 30-minute period ended at 02:29 and Moffset is 15 minutes, then
next activate the GNSS receiver at 03:15, or if Moffset is 44 minutes, then next
activate the GNSS receiver at 02:44);
d) then during each subsequent hour reactivate the GNSS receiver to check for
receipt of an RLM for a minimum period of 15 minutes at Moffset minutes, with
0 ≤ Moffset ≤ 59, past the hour until either an RLM message is received or 6
hours has elapsed since the beacon was activated;
e) if UTC is not available after the first 30 minutes the beacon shall attempt to
establish UTC using the timings detailed in sections 4.5.5.2. If UTC is then
established the beacon shall continue as per c) and d) above from the next
occurrence of UTC Moffset minutes; and
f) once an RLM message is received, or after 6 hours has elapsed since beacon
activation, whichever is sooner, the beacon shall revert to the GNSS timings
in sections 4.5.5.2.
For instance, if the beacon is activated at 03.17h UTC, then the GNSS receiver would
remain active until at least 03.47h UTC or until an RLM message is acquired if sooner,
or the beacon is deactivated if it is deactivated before that time. If an RLM message is
acquired within this period, then the beacon reverts to the GNSS timings in section
4.5.5.2. If an RLM message is not acquired then it would reactivate at the next occurrence
of Moffset past the hour and remain active until at least Moffset+15, or until an RLM message
is acquired, or the beacon is deactivated and it would then reactivate again during the next
hour at Moffset until Moffset+15, etc. The scheme continues as above until an RLM message
is acquired, or 6 hours has elapsed since beacon activation, that is in this example until
09.17h UTC, at which time if an RLM wasn’t acquired earlier the GNSS Receiver reverts
to the GNSS timings in section 4.5.5.2. If the beacon is deactivated, then the entire
operation cycle commences again from the beginning when the beacon is next activated.
NOTE – The Galileo system will cease sending RLM messages back to the beacon, either
once it receives an RLM Acknowledgement confirming that the RLM has been received
by the beacon, or 6 hours have elapsed since the first RLS Request message from the
beacon was received by the RLSP, whichever is the sooner.

There is no specific requirement to deactivate the GNSS receiver between position updates so the “next activation”
may simply consist of ensuring that the GNSS receiver remains on at the start of this period. The GNSS receiver may
have been previously activated due to a required GNSS position update and not as a result of the Moffset timing.
†
Note that in between Moffset activations the GNSS receiver must also comply with the requirements in section 4.5.5.2.
*

4-17

C/S T.018 – Issue 1 Rev. 12
October 2024

The RLS beacon may contain an internal GNSS receiver capable of receiving and
decoding other types of acknowledgment RLM following the same operation cycle as the
one described.
4.5.9.2.2

Derivation of Moffset

The value of Moffset for each beacon is computed from the beacon 15 Hex ID subset of the
23 Hex ID (see section 3.6). More specifically:
Moffset = BIN2DEC (CRC16(Beacon 15 Hex ID in Binary)) mod 60
Where BIN2DEC and CRC16 are functions performing the conversion of binary number
to a decimal number and the CRC-16 of a stream of bits with polynomial x16+x15+x2+1
respectively. The CRC-16 is used to obtain a uniform distribution of Moffset. A sample of
a Moffset calculation and CRC code is shown in Appendix F.
4.5.9.3 RLS Indicator
The beacon shall be provided with an RLS indicator designed to advise the user when a Type 1
RLS message has been received by the RLSP and the beacon has received a Type 1 Return Link
Message (RLM). The RLS Indicator shall:

a) be readily visible to the user when the beacon is operated in all its normal operational
configurations as declared by the manufacturer;
b) be clearly visible to the user in direct sunlight;
c) provide a distinct unique indication;
d) remain inactive at all times when the beacon message is encoded with any message
content other than the RLS Rotating Field;
e) within 5 seconds of the beacon transmitting an initial RLS request, commence
indication of an RLS request until either a valid RLM Type 1 message is received,
or the beacon is deactivated, or the beacon battery is expired;
f) within 5 seconds of the beacon receiving a valid RLM Type 1 message
acknowledgement, commence a distinct indication until either the beacon is deactivated
or the beacon battery is expired;
g) only provide the indication of receipt of an RLS request acknowledgment when the
received RLM Type 1 message contains the unique 15 Hex ID subset of the 23 Hex ID
programmed into that beacon and the beacon has validated that this matches its own
15 Hex ID subset of its 23 Hex ID; and
h) provide an indication during a self-test if the RLS functionality is enabled in accordance
with section 4.5.4.1 e).
4.5.9.4 Confirmation of a Return-Link Message Receipt
Upon receipt of an Acknowledgement Type-1 RLM or a Test RLM associated with the beacon
15 HEX ID, the beacon shall, within 4 minutes and 14 seconds, acknowledge the RLM receipt
by changing the coding of its message as defined in the RLS rotating field, as described in section
3.3. Once changed, the RLM beacon feedback field shall no longer be changed until a different
RLM message is received or beacon is switched off or the beacon battery is depleted.
Once the beacon has received an Acknowledgement Type-1 RLM or a Test RLM and has
acknowledged the RLM receipt, the GNSS Receiver shall continue to function as required by

4-18

C/S T.018 – Issue 1 Rev. 12
October 2024

section 4.5.9.2.1 unless the beacon is coded as a "Type-1 only capable" RLS beacon as defined
in Table 3.5. In this specific case only, the GNSS receiver may revert to operating as defined
within sections 4.5.5.2 and 4.5.5.4, taking into account the time elapsed between the moment of
activation and the moment when the Type-1 RLM message is received, until either the beacon is
deactivated or the beacon performance ceases to meet specification due to battery depletion.
Example
A beacon is activated at 9:00. It transmits emergency signals for 2 hours and 30 minutes. During
the period from 11:00 to 11:15, it receives a Type-1 RLM Acknowledgement. The GNSS
receiver could then revert to operating in accordance to the requirements for internal GNSS
receiver without the RLS capability which specifies that, the navigation device shall attempt
location update at least once every 15 minutes, for a period of at least 90 seconds, or until an
updated location is obtained, if sooner.
4.5.9.5 RLS Beacon Documentation
The operation of the RLS Type 1 automatic acknowledgement function shall be clearly explained
in the User Manual including the performance characteristics of the overall RLS system.
Suggested minimum text is provided in Annex H.1.
4.5.10

Battery Status Indication

The battery status indication provides the user with an indication prior to beacon activation that the
battery may be partially depleted and may not operate for the full specified operating lifetime.
Beacons powered by a rechargeable battery shall automatically provide an indication when the battery
requires recharging.
Beacons powered by a non-rechargeable battery shall provide an indication of battery status during
self-tests. This shall be a separate indication to the self-test pass/fail indication and the battery status
indicator shall provide a distinct indication of Potentially Insufficient Battery Energy (PIE). That is,
that the remaining battery energy may not be sufficient to support the manufacturer declared
minimum duration of continuous beacon operation.
4.5.11

Beacon Labelling

All beacons shall have the following information durably marked on the exterior of the beacon:

*

1)

Beacon 23 Hex ID (the 23 Hex ID shall be displayed as:
NNNNNN NNNNNN NNNNNN NNNNN (i.e., a space after every 6 characters))

2)

The beacon operating temperature range

3)

The minimum duration of continuous operation

4)

For RLS-capable beacons, wording on the Beacon Identity label (TAC / Hex ID Label)
indicating whether the RLS function is enabled or disabled

5)

For RLS-capable beacons*, a label indicating which are the RLS and RLM indicator(s).

Labeling of the RLS and RLM indicator(s), is independent of the value of bit 42, and whether there is a rotating field #2.

C/S T.018 – Issue 1 Rev. 12
October 2024

4-19

If applicable, all Programming Adapters shall be durably marked with the Beacon Model that it
relates to and its own unique TAC and Serial Number. In addition there shall be sufficient space to
provide the Country Code and Vessel ID information that will be programmed into the adapter.
4.5.12

Beacon Instruction Manual

An End User instruction manual shall be made available with all beacons, it shall include the
information as outlined in the data item description (Annex H.1.10 of document C/S T.021).
4.5.13

Beacon Data Requirements

The manufacturer shall make available for the purposes of supporting the type approval review the
information as outlined in the data item description (Annex G-3 and Annex H.1 of document C/S
T.021).
4.5.14

External Power Source for ELT(DT)s

The ELT(DT) shall have its own integral or internal power source. However, when available, all
ELT(DT)s (including those in compliance with sections 4.5.15 and 4.5.16) may use the external
aircraft electrical power source. An ELT(DT) shall comply with all applicable requirements
regardless of power source. In addition, the ELT(DT) performance shall not be impacted by switching
between power sources.
4.5.15

ELT(DT)s Specifically Designed to Withstand a Crash Impact

4.5.15.1 Introduction
Potentially there may be ELT(DT)s that have additional functionality, as defined by National
Administrations and/or Aviation Authorities, which are designed to:
1)
2)
3)
4)

function both prior to a crash and after a crash, and withstand crash impact conditions;
be activated in-flight or by crash;
have homing and locating signals; and/or
have extended operating life.

Crash Survivable ELT(DT)s should function as follows.

If the beacon is activated in one aircraft state (e.g., in-flight) and the aircraft transitions to
another state (e.g., on-ground) while the beacon is still transmitting, the beacon transmission
characteristics should behave as indicated for the new aircraft state as per the table above.
If there is a conflict between the requirements of this section and any other section of this
document, then this section takes precedence.
4.5.15.2 Beacon Hex ID
The Hex ID of the ELT(DT) shall not change from when activated in-flight compared to when
operating after a crash.
4.5.15.3 Burst Transmission Interval (with Crash Detection)
If the ELT(DT) includes a crash detection function, within 5 seconds of a crash the ELT(DT)
shall initiate or restart the transmission schedule for an ELT(DT) as if the ELT(DT) had just
been activated as defined in section 2.2.1 and maintain this transmission schedule for the first
95 bursts (i.e., approximately 30 minutes) after the crash detection. After burst number 95 (after
crash detection), transmissions shall then occur at nominally 120 second intervals. The time
between the start of two successive transmissions (TR) shall be randomized with uniform (flat)
distribution around the stated nominal value, so that the time intervals between the beginnings
of two successive bursts (TR) are randomly distributed over ± 5 seconds. After burst number
95 (after crash detection), the standard deviation over the next 20 successive bursts of TR shall
be greater than 2.5 seconds. The minimum value of TR observed over the 20 successive bursts
shall be between 115.0 and 115.2 seconds, the maximum value of TR observed over the 20
successive bursts shall be between 124.8 and 125.0 seconds.
Operation after 370 minutes without crash detection
If, after 370 minutes of in-flight operation, the ELT(DT) has not transitioned to a post-crash
mode or has not been deactivated, then it shall continue transmitting on the same schedule
(with the GNSS encoded location updated before each transmitted burst) as before the 370minute limit was reached until the ELT(DT) is either deactivated, gets a subsequent “crash”
indication to transition to the “post-crash” mode, runs out of battery life, or reaches the
minimum duration of continuous operation, whichever occurs first.

C/S T.018 – Issue 1 Rev. 12
October 2024

4-21

4.5.15.4 GNSS Update Rate (after Crash Detection)
During a 30-minute period after a crash detection, the GNSS encoded location shall be updated
before each transmitted burst, as per sections 4.5.5.1, 4.5.5.3 and 4.5.5.4 (if applicable).
Beyond 30 minutes, the GNSS encoded location shall be updated in accordance with section
4.5.5.1, 4.5.5.2 and 4.5.5.4 (if applicable).
4.5.15.5 Duration of Continuous Operation
The minimum duration of continuous operation under worst case conditions for this type of
ELT(DT) shall be at least 24 hours at any temperature throughout the specified operating
temperature range. This is to be understood to mean the total operating time which is a
combination of the time prior to a crash (minimum of 10 minutes and maximum of 370
minutes) and post-crash. For the avoidance of doubt, if the ELT(DT) continues to operate after
370 minutes without crash detection then the 24-hour minimum duration of continuous
operation does not apply, and might be reduced as a result of the extended operation in this
pre-crash mode.
4.5.15.6 Homing and Locating Signals
The inclusion or otherwise of one or more homing signals in the ELT(DT) and the activation
and duration of any homing signal transmissions are the responsibility of national
administrations.

4.5.16

ELT(DT)s Combined with Automatic ELTs

4.5.16.1 Introduction
Potentially there may be ELT(DT)s that have combined functionality, that is they function as an
ELT(DT) during a flight, but on detection of an incident perform as an Automatic ELT (either
an ELT(AD), ELT(AF) or ELT(AP)), such a combined ELT would be required to meet the
regulatory requirements set by National Administrations and/or Aviation Authorities, for both an
ELT(DT) and the type of Automatic ELT that it is combined with.
However, from a Cospas-Sarsat perspective there are certain key functions of such a combined
ELT that need to be clearly defined related to its performance and operation and the transition
from an ELT(DT) to either an ELT(AD), ELT(AF) or ELT(AP) as follows.
ELT(DT)s combined with Automatic ELTs should function as follows.

If the beacon is activated in one aircraft state (e.g., in-flight) and the aircraft transitions to another
state (e.g., on-ground) while the beacon is still transmitting, the beacon transmission
characteristics should behave as indicated for the new aircraft state as per the table above.
If there is a conflict between the requirements of this section and any other section of this
document, then this section takes precedence.
4.5.16.2 Beacon Coding and Beacon Hex ID
The combined ELT(DT) and Automatic ELT shall transmit the ELT(DT) In-Flight Emergency
Rotating Field #1 at all times and shall not change to transmitting the Objective Requirements
Rotating Field #0 when the combined device transitions to or is activated as an Automatic ELT.
The 23 Hex ID shall remain the same regardless of whether the device is operating as an
ELT(DT) or as an automatic ELT.
Bit 42 in the combined device message shall remain as “0” indicating that the device is not
equipped with the RLS capability and shall not change to “1” when the combined device
transitions to or is activated as an Automatic ELT.
Bits 138 to 140 in the combined device message shall remain as “011” indicating that the device
is an ELT(DT) and shall not change to “000” when the combined device transitions to or is
activated as an Automatic ELT.
4.5.16.3 Burst Transmission Interval
When activated as an ELT(DT) the beacon shall meet the burst repetition requirements for an
ELT(DT) as defined in section 2.2.1. When activated as an Automatic ELT or if transitioning
from an ELT(DT) to an Automatic ELT then the combined device shall commence the burst
repetition requirements for a non-ELT(DT) 406 MHz beacon as defined in section 2.2.1 (i.e.,
restart the Initial IAMSAR stage transmission schedule).
Operation after 370 minutes without crash detection
If, after 370 minutes of in-flight operation, the ELT(DT) has not transitioned to a post-crash mode
or has not been deactivated, then it shall continue transmitting on the same schedule (with the
GNSS encoded location updated before each transmitted burst) as before the 370-minute limit

4-23

C/S T.018 – Issue 1 Rev. 12

was reached until the ELT(DT) is either deactivated, gets a subsequent “crash” indication to
transition to the “post-crash” (Automatic ELT) mode, runs out of battery life, or reaches the
minimum duration of continuous operation, whichever occurs first.
4.5.16.4 System Requirements
The combined ELT(DT) and Automatic ELT shall meet the more stringent requirements, that
apply to either part of the device (except where stated otherwise below), specifically:
a) the combined ELT(DT) and Automatic ELT does not have to meet the requirement for
90% of measured EIRP values to meet the limits shown at elevation angles below 55
degrees (but does have to meet the other requirements in section 2.4.2);
b) the combined device shall comply with both the Temperature Gradient requirements for
an ELT(DT) and the Temperature Gradient requirements for a regular 406 MHz beacon,
based upon the declared temperature classes for each part of the device (section 4.2.2);
c) the combined ELT(DT) shall not be required to track time since activation (since it will
not be transmitting Rotating Field #0) (section 4.5.6); and
d) the combined ELT(DT) shall comply with the modes of operation for an ELT(DT)
(section 4.5.6.1).
4.5.16.5 Cancellation Message
The cancellation message shall function as defined in section 4.5.7 while operating as an
Automatic ELT as well as while operating as an ELT(DT).
4.5.16.6 Encoded Position Data and Navigation Device Performance
While operating as an ELT(DT) the navigation device shall comply with the requirements of
sections 4.5.5.1, 4.5.5.3 and 4.5.5.4 (if applicable). When operating as an Automatic ELT, that is
automatically activated, the navigation device shall comply with the requirements of sections
4.5.5.1, 4.5.5.2 and 4.5.5.4 (if applicable). When operating as an Automatic ELT, that is manually
activated, the navigation device shall comply with the requirements of sections 4.5.5.1, 4.5.5.3
and 4.5.5.4 (if applicable), for a period of at least 6 hours and 10 minutes, after which time it shall
comply with the requirements of sections 4.5.5.1, 4.5.5.2 and 4.5.5.4 (if applicable).
4.5.16.7 Duration of Continuous Operation
The minimum duration of continuous operation under worst case conditions for this type of
combined ELT shall be a combination of the minimum duration of continuous operation for an
ELT(DT) (370 minutes) and the minimum duration of continuous operation for a regular 406
MHz beacon (24 hours), thus resulting in a total of at least 30 hours and 10 minutes.
For the avoidance of doubt, if the combined ELT continues to operate after 370 minutes without
crash detection, then the 30 hours and 10 minutes minimum duration of continuous operation
does not apply and might be reduced as a result of the extended operation in the ELT(DT) mode.
4.5.16.8 Class of Operation
The combined device may, if required, function at different classes of temperature as an
ELT(DT) or Automatic ELT (e.g., the ELT(DT) part of the device may be specified to operate

4-24

C/S T.018 – Issue 1 Rev. 12
October 2024

as a Class 1 device, while the Automatic ELT part of the device may be specified to operate as a
Class 2 device).
4.5.16.9 Homing and Locating Signals
The inclusion or otherwise of one or more homing signals in the combined device and the
activation and duration of any homing signal transmissions are the responsibility of national
administrations. The status of the homing signals in the transmitted beacon message shall comply
with Table 3.1.

4.5.17

RLS Type 3 TWC (message) Functionality

If a beacon is equipped with an RLS Type 3 Two-Way Communication (TWC) (message) functionality
and is configured to transmit the RLS Type 3 TWC Rotating Field, it shall meet the following
additional requirements.
4.5.17.1 RLS Type 3 TWC (message) Mode of Operation
If the RLS Type 3 Two-Way Communication (TWC) (message) functionality is enabled on a
beacon, after activation and start of transmissions in accordance with section 2.2.1, the TWC
capable beacon shall display the initial automatic questions.
Starting from beacon activation, RF#4 and RF#0 shall be transmitted.
The initial questions shall be made available to the beacon user sequentially and the next one
shall be made available only when the previous one is answered by the user. However, the beacon
may provide an option to skip a particular question. If a follow-on question or instruction is
received during the initial questions answering phase, it shall be prioritized over the remaining
initial questions.
The priority among follow-on questions or instructions shall be the order of reception by the
beacon.
If the RLS Type 3 Two-Way Communication (TWC) (message) functionality in the beacon is
not enabled, then the user shall be advised of this.
The bit assignment in the RF#4 defined in Table 3.11 is represented hereafter:

Figure 4-2: RF#4 bit assignment representation with the FLAM

4-25

C/S T.018 – Issue 1 Rev. 12
October 2024

This assignment enables having 3 slots of 11 bits each for Questions/Answers or
Instructions/Reception Acknowledgements per burst.
4.5.17.2 RLS Type 3 Two-Way Communication (TWC) (message) Operation
All the answers to initial or follow-on questions shall be transmitted as soon as available in the
next RF#4 (i.e., the beacon shall not wait until all three Q&A slots in the message have been
filled). In the event that the number of answers to be sent exceed the number of slots available in
the RF#4 (i.e., 3 slots), the answers shall be stacked and sent in different successive RF#4 bursts
without waiting for acknowledgements from the TWC-SP. The answers sent in the RF#4s rotate,
meaning that for example, if 6 answers have to be sent, the first 3 in stack are transmitted, then
the next 3 answers, then the first 3 answers again etc.
4.5.17.2.1

Operation with Initial Q&As

Upon activation the beacon transmits RF#4 with default Q&As in slots 1, 2 and 3 until either an
Initial Question is answered or a Follow-on Question or Instruction is received (see 4.5.17.2.2
below).
a) Once the user answers the first Question this is inserted in Slot 1 together with its
Answer and is transmitted in the next RF#4 burst. This process is repeated for
subsequent Initial Q&As using other Slots in the message as available. If there are more
Questions than Slots available then Q&As are stacked and alternated in subsequent
RF#4s as outlined above.
b) Once an Initial Q&A has been received by the TWC-SP, it will be acknowledged by
sending an Acknowledgement for the specific question (or questions) back to the beacon
in an RLM containing the beacons 15 Hex ID (truncated from the 23 Hex ID).
c) [Upon receipt of the Acknowledgement to a specific question the beacon will continue
to transmit the Question in the next RF#4 burst but will change the Answer to Default
(this will advise the TWC-SP that it can now stop transmitting the Acknowledgement
for that specific question).]
d) [The beacon shall transmit the Question with the Default Answer in [5] bursts (as a
means to try and ensure that the TWC-SP receives this message), after this period of
time the beacon reverts to transmitting default data in both the Q&A part of the Slot
until such time as this Slot is required to send another Q&A.]
e) The same strategy applies to any other Initial Q&As, which may be contained in the
same 406 MHz burst as the first Q&A, or may be in later bursts depending on the speed
at which the user answers the Initial Questions.
f) Once all the Initial Questions have been addressed, unless one or more Follow-on
Questions or Instructions have been received, the beacon will revert to transmitting
default Q&As.

4-26

C/S T.018 – Issue 1 Rev. 12
October 2024

As noted above, the Initial Q&A session may be interrupted by the reception of a Follow-on
Question or Instruction from an RCC or SPOC. In this case this Follow-on question shall take
precedence over any unanswered Initial Questions.
Note that Slots in the message are generic as each Slot contains all necessary data, thus it does
not matter if a specific Q&A is for example transmitted in Slot 2 in one RF#4 and is then
subsequently transmitted in Slot 1 in a later RF#4.
4.5.17.2.2

Operation with Follow-on Q&As or Instructions

The beacon will either not have answered any of the Initial Questions, or still be answering Initial
Questions, or will have finished with all of these and will thus have reverted to transmitting
default Q&As, regardless of when it receives one or more Follow-on Question(s) or Instruction(s)
it handles them as follows.
a) As soon as the beacon receives a Follow-on Question or Instruction in an RLM
containing the beacons 15 Hex ID (truncated from the 23 Hex ID) it shall, transmit the
Follow-on Question / Instruction Number with a Default answer in a free Slot in the
next RF#4 (this informs the TWC-SP that the Question / Instruction has been received).
b) If there is not a free Slot in which to transmit the follow-on Question / Instruction, then
this shall replace the newest other Q&A in whichever Slot it occupies in RF#4. This
other Q&A shall then be transmitted in the next RF#4. RF#4 transmissions then alternate
between the sets of Q&As until one or more Slots can be freed up as the result of
completing the handshake with the TWC-SP. At which time the beacon reverts to
providing all outstanding Q&As in a single RF#4.
c) If further Questions or Instructions are received, they shall be handled in the same
manner as in (a) above in the order of reception by the beacon.
d) If the user has not yet answered all of the Initial Questions then any Follow-on Questions
or Instructions take priority over these in terms of being presented to the user for
answering. Once the Follow-on Questions or Instructions have been answered the
beacon shall revert to displaying any remaining unanswered Initial Questions to the user,
or if there are no more Questions or Instructions then the user shall be advised of this.
e) Once the user answers a Follow-on Question or Instruction, then the message containing
the Question / Instruction Number shall be updated with the relevant Answer instead of
the default which shall be transmitted in the next RF#4.
f) The beacon shall continue to transmit the Follow-on Question or Instruction with its
Answer until it receives an RLM Acknowledging receipt containing the beacons 15 Hex
ID (truncated from the 23 Hex ID). Once the beacon receives the acknowledgment it
shall cease transmitting the Follow-on Question or Instruction with its Answer.
Once all the Initial Questions and Follow-on Questions or Instructions have been addressed, the
beacon will revert to transmitting default Q&As.

4-27

C/S T.018 – Issue 1 Rev. 12
October 2024

Note that Slots in the message are generic as each Slot contains all necessary data, thus it does
not matter if a specific Q&A is for example transmitted in Slot 2 in one RF#4 and is then
subsequently transmitted in Slot 1 in a later RF#4.
4.5.17.3 GNSS Receiver
The RLS Type-3 TWC GNSS receiver shall comply with the requirements in section 4.5.9.1.
4.5.17.3.1

RLS Type-3 TWC GNSS Receiver Operation

In addition to the beacons normal GNSS receiver operating cycle as defined in section
4.5.5.2 or as defined by the beacon manufacturer if the receiver is designed to be active
more frequently than those requirements, the TWC beacon shall:
a) when encoded with TWC functionality (i.e., transmitting an TWC Rotating Field)
maintain the GNSS receiver in an active mode of operation such that it can continuously
check for receipt of an RLM message and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), for a
minimum period of 1 hour after beacon activation, or until the beacon is deactivated,
whichever occurs first;
b) as soon as possible determine UTC from the GNSS receiver and maintain a clock for at
least 6 hours from the time the beacon was first activated, to the accuracy of better than
three seconds (once UTC has been acquired) or until the beacon is deactivated (if UTC
is not acquired see (e) below);
c) [after the first hour and each subsequent hour reactivate the GNSS receiver to check for
receipt of an RLM for a minimum period of 15 minutes at Moffset minutes, with 0 ≤ Moffset
≤ 59, past the hour until 6 hours has elapsed since the beacon was activated; ]
d) [if UTC is not available after the first 30 minutes the beacon shall attempt to establish
UTC using the timings detailed in sections 4.5.5.2. If UTC is then established the beacon
shall continue as per c) and d) above from the next occurrence of UTC Moffset minutes;
and]
e) [after 6 hours has elapsed since beacon activation the beacon shall revert to the GNSS
timings in sections 4.5.5.2.]
[For instance, if the beacon is activated at 03.17h UTC, then the GNSS receiver would
remain active until at least 04.17h UTC or the beacon is deactivated if it is deactivated
before that time. The beacon shall reactivate at the next occurrence of Moffset past the hour
and remain active until at least Moffset+15, or the beacon is deactivated and it would then
reactivate again during the next hour at Moffset until Moffset+15, etc. The scheme continues
as above until 6 hours has elapsed since beacon activation, that is in this example until
09.17h UTC, at which time the GNSS Receiver reverts to the GNSS timings in section
4.5.5.2. If the beacon is deactivated, then the entire operation cycle commences again
from the beginning when the beacon is next activated.]
The RLS beacon may contain an internal GNSS receiver capable of receiving and
decoding other types of acknowledgment RLM following the same operation cycle as the
one described.

[RLS Type-3 TWC (message) Beacon Use of Moffset]

[The derivation of Moffset is defined in section 4.5.9.2.2.]
4.5.17.4 RLS Type 3 Two-Way Communication (TWC) (message) Indicator
The beacon shall be provided with a TWC indicator designed to advise the user when the first TWC
message has been received by the TWC-SP and the beacon has received the first Type-3 Return Link
Message (RLM). The TWC Indicator shall:
a) be readily visible to the user when the beacon is operated in all its normal operational
configurations as declared by the manufacturer;
b) be clearly visible to the user in direct sunlight;
c) provide a distinct unique indication;
d) remain inactive at all times when the beacon message is encoded with any message
content other than the TWC Rotating Field;
e) within 5 seconds of the beacon transmitting an initial Type-3 request, commence
indication of the request until either the valid RLM Type-3 message is received, or the
beacon is deactivated, or the beacon battery is expired;
f) within 5 seconds of the beacon receiving the first valid Type-3 RLM message
acknowledgement, commence a distinct indication until either the beacon is deactivated
or the beacon battery is expired;
g) only provide the indication of receipt of a Type-3 request acknowledgment when the
received RLM Type-3 message contains the unique 15 Hex ID subset of the 23- Hex ID
programmed into that beacon and the beacon has validated that this matches its own 15Hex ID subset of its 23- Hex ID;
h) provide an indication during a self-test if the TWC functionality is enabled in
accordance with section 4.5.4.1; and
i) be distinct from the RLS indicator described in Section 4.5.9.3.

4.5.17.5 RLS Type 3 TWC (message) Beacon Documentation
The operation of the TWC function shall be clearly explained in the User Manual including the
performance characteristics of the overall TWC system. Suggested minimum text is provided in
Annex H.2.
